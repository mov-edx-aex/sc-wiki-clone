=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist low security chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems the route generator of the autopilot will have you fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note: The autopilot generated routes are not necessarily the only routes you can fly. If you want to avoid pirates in above systems it is advised to consult the ingame star map or the maps of [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/ Dotlan] before flight. Also you can alter the initial  routefinding by putting waypoints or putting systems on the &amp;quot;avoidance list&amp;quot; within the autopilot. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like [https://eveeye.com/?m=Regions&amp;amp;o=nodeout_sec,node_sec,sub_npcs,sector_none,tag_none,etag_sig,con_none,thera,dark EvEye] and [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/ DotLan] maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Using special &amp;quot;Proving Ground Filaments&amp;quot; to access the Abyssal Proving Grounds is prohibited for Signal Cartel pilots, as use of these filaments initiates a PVP encounter 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The site [https://whtype.info/ Wormhole types] lists all known wormhole typs and provides infos attached to the type in a graphical way. Use with care as the information may not always be 100% accurate.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;
===Dangerous Unknown Space - Class 4 and 5===&lt;br /&gt;
===Deadly Unknown Space - Class 6===&lt;br /&gt;

==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Sightseeing New Eden=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New Eden is wonderful and there is much to navigate to. There are lost places, marks of history and lots to discover. Some of the most wonderful places (and always worth a well planned exploration) are described in  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Adopted|Vendres Olo|689214714|2024-04|Sections 2 to 6}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist low security chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems the route generator of the autopilot will have you fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note: The autopilot generated routes are not necessarily the only routes you can fly. If you want to avoid pirates in above systems it is advised to consult the ingame star map or the maps of [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/ Dotlan] before flight. Also you can alter the initial  routefinding by putting waypoints or putting systems on the &amp;quot;avoidance list&amp;quot; within the autopilot. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Using special &amp;quot;Proving Ground Filaments&amp;quot; to access the Abyssal Proving Grounds is prohibited for Signal Cartel pilots, as use of these filaments initiates a PVP encounter 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Wormhole Types==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The site [https://whtype.info/ Wormhole types] lists all known wormhole typs and provides infos attached to the type in a graphical way. Use with care as the information may not always be 100% accurate.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;
===Dangerous Unknown Space - Class 4 and 5===&lt;br /&gt;
===Deadly Unknown Space - Class 6===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Sightseeing New Eden=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New Eden is wonderful and there is much to navigate to. There are lost places, marks of history and lots to discover. Some of the most wonderful places (and always worth a well planned exploration) are described in  &lt;br /&gt;

=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Using special &amp;quot;Proving Ground Filaments&amp;quot; to access the Abyssal Proving Grounds is prohibited for Signal Cartel pilots, as use of these filaments initiates a PVP encounter 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;The videos in this section were linked with the kind permission of their owner, [https://evewho.com/character/2115613686 Sothis Ast], owner of the [https://whtype.info/ whtype] website.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

The site [https://whtype.info/ Wormhole types] lists all known wormhole typs and provides infos attached to the type in a graphical way. Use with care as the information may not always be 100% accurate.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;

==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Sightseeing New Eden=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New Eden is wonderful and there is much to navigate to. There are lost places, marks of history and lots to discover. Some of the most wonderful places (and always worth a well planned exploration) are described in  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Adopted|Vendres Olo|689214714|2024-04|Sections 2 to 6}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Using special &amp;quot;Proving Ground Filaments&amp;quot; to access the Abyssal Proving Grounds is prohibited for Signal Cartel pilots, as use of these filaments initiates a PVP encounter 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Size !! Visual !! Ships able to jump through&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Sightseeing New Eden=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New Eden is wonderful and there is much to navigate to. There are lost places, marks of history and lots to discover. Some of the most wonderful places (and always worth a well planned exploration) are described in  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Using special &amp;quot;Proving Ground Filaments&amp;quot; to access the Abyssal Proving Grounds is prohibited for Signal Cartel pilots, as use of these filaments initiates a PVP encounter 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;The videos in this section were linked with the kind permission of their owner, [https://evewho.com/character/2115613686 Sothis Ast], owner of the [https://whtype.info/ whtype] website.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Using special &amp;quot;Proving Ground Filaments&amp;quot; to access the Abyssal Proving Grounds is prohibited for Signal Cartel pilots, as use of these filaments initiates a PVP encounter 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Size !! Visual !! Ships able to jump through&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;[[File:Look at button.png|Look at]]&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Wormhole Types==&lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;
===Dangerous Unknown Space - Class 4 and 5===&lt;br /&gt;
===Deadly Unknown Space - Class 6===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Deadspace==&lt;br /&gt;
Abyssal Deadspace is a area of isolated space. The Deadspace consists of three bubbles which have to be fought through (PvE) in order to return to your starting point. The Deadspace can only be reached by the use of special filaments. Each bubble will collapse after a certain time resulting in the loss of your ship and pod if you were not able to leave the bubble before. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Abyssal Proving Grounds==&lt;br /&gt;
The Abyssal Proving Grounds are similar bubbles like Abyssal Deadspace but with PvP challenges. Please note that due to Signal Cartels neutral position ist is not allowed to participate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Gallente.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Gallente space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Minmatar.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Minmatar space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Size !! Visual !! Ships able to jump through&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| &amp;lt;center&amp;gt;M&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt; || [[File:M_hole.webm|class=loopme]] || Up to battlecruisers&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;[[File:Look at button.png|Look at]]&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;
An other station is run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds two offices in a wormhole system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;
An other station is run by [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;The videos in this section were linked with the kind permission of their owner, [https://evewho.com/character/2115613686 Sothis Ast], owner of the [https://whtype.info/ whtype] website.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;

====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;[[File:Look at button.png|Look at]]&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Wormhole Types==&lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;
===Dangerous Unknown Space - Class 4 and 5===&lt;br /&gt;
===Deadly Unknown Space - Class 6===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds one office in a low security system system: &lt;br /&gt;
:Ststion: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds an office in Lowsec in the system of Turnur: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;

When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds an office in Lowsec in the system of Turnur: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel holds an office in Lowsec in the system of Turnur: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Gallente.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Gallente space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Minmatar.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Minmatar space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Size !! Visual !! Ships able to jump through&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, The Explorer&#039;s Handbook is a rough outline - but eventually, it will become your trusted exploration guide to New Eden, Anoikis, and beyond. However, we need &#039;&#039;your help&#039;&#039; to make this a reality.  Please participate in our &#039;&#039;&#039;[[Adopt-A-Page | Exploration Adopt-A-Page Initiative]]&#039;&#039;&#039;!  Your contributions are greatly appreciated. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Overview of Exploration ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Exploration in EVE is a multi-faceted endeavor. Whether your interests lie with the sheer thrill of discovery; seeking out forgotten sites and retrieving long lost relics and secret data caches; finding and mining rare and valuable resources; or battling with strange and deadly foes in the night between the stars - you can find it in exploration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== The Basic Loop === &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s all well and good you say, but what is the minute to minute experience of exploration?  The basic gameplay loop when you&#039;re exploring looks like the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
#Ensure your safety through smart habits.  &lt;br /&gt;
#Navigate to a system to explore in.  &lt;br /&gt;
#Locate Signatures and/or Landmarks. This is primarily done via scanning probes, but also can be done via Bookmarks.  &lt;br /&gt;
#Interact with your chosen Signature/Landmark. This may include hacking, gas huffing, combat or simply enjoying the view.  &lt;br /&gt;
#Collect the reward (and eventually sell it). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player can start their exploration career on their very first day. Exploration is an activity that grows with you.  As you get more skilled, as you get more resources and experience, you will find your horizons expanding in new, more dangerous, and potentially more profitable ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE provides a wealth of diverse geography, locations, landmarks, and loot for you to find.  Combined with the unique navigation and Player vs. Player elements inherent in both normal space (K-Space) and wormhole space (J-Space) this basic loop provides an incredible amount of depth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, exploration is a uniquely personal activity in New Eden. You do not have to be in a small gang or a large fleet to get things done and be effective. While there are times where you may be venturing out into the unknown with friends, much of the time you simply do your own thing with all the freedom and peril that entails.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Sites ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are five kinds of exploration sites one might encounter while participating in exploration activities, these being mining sites, gas sites, combat sites, relic sites, and data sites. Mining and combat sites will often appear as anomalies without having to scan them down with a core probe launcher, and work very much like mining and combat anomalies in other aspects of the game. Gas sites operate like mining anomalies, save for that instead of ore or ice to mine, they have gas deposits that one can collect with gas scoops or gas harvesters. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Relic and data sites are unique in that they require specialized analyzers fitted to your ship in order to interact with them. Both of them contain different cannisters one must access with the relevant analyzer module, which opens the hacking minigame. Once the minigame is complete, one can open the cannister to take the contents, which may be anything from an empty cache to tens of millions of ISK worth of scavenged materials.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sixth &#039;site&#039; you may encounter, wormholes, are not really a site at all, but more akin to a doorway. They can lead anywhere, from high sec space, to null sec, to the unknown depths of wormhole space. Be careful with these, they won&#039;t automatically be marked on your scanner on the other side, so we recommend bookmarking your exits so you can get back if need be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Treating ships like ammo ==&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Exploration is a high risk/reward activity, every time you undock a ship have the mindset that you already lost it. Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 Exploration frigates in most of our stations, use them to learn and explore all corners of EVE Universe.&lt;br /&gt;
A good rule of thumb is to seldom undock something you can not replace twice (there are always exceptions to the rule).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Navigation is the art of finding  your way and safly travel. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It consists of knowing and assesing where you are, finding an optimal route and to fly safe regardless of the dangers in New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;

This article covers how to play the [[Hacking |Hacking Minigame]], which sites contain hackable containers, and lists the tools of the trade (skills, ships, modules and implants) needed to make a successful hack. In basic terms, the goal of this minigame is to find and defeat the system core without losing coherence to the defensive subsystems that protect the core. This is done by following the various routes through the system, paying attention to the numbers presented. The number indicates how many nodes away a utility system, data cache, or system core is. One can use utility systems as &#039;power ups&#039; to defeat the defensive subsystems, while data caches my hide either a defensive subsystem or a utility subsystem. [https://youtu.be/SeEW0_3ksX0 This] video guide, as well as [https://youtu.be/UThezypQ3Ts this] follow up, contain a multitude of tips and tricks to make it through the hacking minigame most effectively.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Making ISK as an Explorer==&lt;br /&gt;
We all need ISK to buy and equip ships in EVE Online. The objective of [[Making ISK as an Explorer|this article]] is to discuss strategies for extracting more ISK from exploration activities. It covers three main topics:&lt;br /&gt;
# What exploration sites and loot yield the best ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
# How to haul your loot back to locations where it can be converted to ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
# What methods are available to sell or to generate ISK from your loot.&lt;br /&gt;

=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can travel from one faction warfare areas to another via Lowsec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;The videos in this section were linked with the kind permission of their owner, [https://evewho.com/character/2115613686 Sothis Ast], owner of the [https://whtype.info/ whtype] website.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;

====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Adopted|Vendres Olo|689214714|2024-04|Sections 2 to 6}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Hisec Enclaves===&lt;br /&gt;
There are Hisec systems that have no safe route (via Hisec systems) to other Hisec systems but are surrounded by Lowsec or Nullsec systems. They are not special but you should be aware that they exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Wormhole Types==&lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;
===Dangerous Unknown Space - Class 4 and 5===&lt;br /&gt;
===Deadly Unknown Space - Class 6===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;

====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Routes through Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;[[File:Look at button.png|Look at]]&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Wormhole Types==&lt;br /&gt;
===Unknown Space - Class 1-3===&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Lowsec Topology==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through.

=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Adopted|Vendres Olo|689214714|2024-04|Sections 2 to 6}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Hisec Topology== &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Adopted|Vendres Olo|689214714|2024-04|Sections 2 to 6}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec Topology= &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;[[File:Look at button.png|Look at]]&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Triglavian invasion changed the topology of Hisec routes significantly for navigation (see above). After the invasion the Pochven region consits of 27 systems that were conquered by the Triglavian Collective and owned by three clades (Perun, Veles and Svarog). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As old stargates do not work into the region, there are only two ways to fly to Pochven: You can use filaments or fly in via wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
To use a filament you need to be in a fleet, even if it is only a fleet by yourself. The name of the filament will indicate where you land: Border-, Inner- or Home- Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole types C729, U372 and F216 lead to pochven. Types C729, X450 and R081 spawn in Pochven and lead outbound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within Pochven you can use conduit gates to move from system to system. These do function as stargates. Access is determined by the level of your standings with the Triglavian Collective. As an example gates which lead into a clade home system require a 7.0 standing to use, however when entered from the home system they are unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump) after the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;

====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump).&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4). &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr: Vecamia (0.4).&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;

This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump).&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Bookmarking Exits==&lt;br /&gt;
==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;

See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump).&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lowsec systems provide often significant shortcuts for longer Hisec trading routes. There do exist lowsec chokepoints on this routes, meaning systems you have to fly through. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, pirates are often operating in these: &lt;br /&gt;
Between Minmatar and Caldari: Miroitem (0.3) and Rancer (0.4)&lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente/Minmatar and Amarr: Amamake (0.4) and Auga (0.4) &lt;br /&gt;
Between Gallente - Concord Assembly and Amarr:  Vecamia (0.4)&lt;br /&gt;
Between Caldari and Gallente: Tama (0.3)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Visual Identification===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;The videos in this section were linked with the kind permission of their owner, [https://evewho.com/character/2115613686 Sothis Ast], owner of the [https://whtype.info/ whtype] website.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump).&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Topologically Hisec was a ring at the beginning of eve. You could thus travel via Hisec in a &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;
Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire - Caldari State.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition from Gallente Federation there exist Hisec Routes to CONCORD Assembly and the Genesis Enclave of Amarr Empire. From Amarr Empire you can reach the Khanid Kingdom.   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
With the invasion of the Triglavian this &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot; was broken and the secure connection between Amarr Empire and Caldari Sate lost, so the circle becomes a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian | Caldari State - Gallente Fedearation - Minmatar Republic - Ammatar Mandate - Amarr Empire | Triglavian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you want to travel via Hisec from Amarr (Amarr Space) to Jita (Caldari space) you will have to go via Amarr Mandate and Minmatar Republic. Thus especially the Route from Amarr to Jita, the main trade hubs, increased significantly (from 9-jump to 44-jump).&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are shorter routes, but those include always at least one Lowsec system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| [[File:Amarr.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Amarr space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;|| [[File:Caldari.webm|400px|center|class=loopme]]&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Caldari space.&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
======Null-sec======&lt;br /&gt;
When jumping into Null-sec, your only clue is the look of the clouds and your own knowledge of NS systems to recognize them.&lt;br /&gt;
You can try to find the region by using the very well made &amp;quot;[https://ashyin.space/wormhole-identification/ Modern Guide to Wormhole Identification]&amp;quot; website&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Maximum size allowed to jump through====&lt;br /&gt;
This information is given by the color of the arms moving around the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Size !! Visual !! Ships able to jump through&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

=Fundamentals of navigation in EVE Online=&lt;br /&gt;
Like so much else in EVE Online, movement and navigation are complex.  There are three separate layers, each with their own mechanisms and operating at very different scales:&lt;br /&gt;
* The finest-granularity control is on what is known as the &#039;&#039;&#039;grid&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Here is where fighting, hacking, and mining are controlled and determined.&lt;br /&gt;
* The next level up is that of the &#039;&#039;&#039;star system&#039;&#039;&#039;, where players can warp between the system&#039;s star, celestials, and, structures and sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* Finally, the player can navigate &#039;&#039;&#039;between star systems&#039;&#039;&#039; using gates and wormholes.  New Eden is made up of roughly 5000 systems connected by static gates and a further 2600 connected by dynamic wormholes. &lt;br /&gt;
The following sections deal with each in turn.  Successful gameplay requires understanding and mastery of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==On-grid maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[On-grid_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==In-system navigation and maneuvering==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Inter-system navigation in New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Inter-system_navigation_in_New_Eden|this page]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Hisec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 1.0 and 0.5 are considered High-Sec. In High-Sec space CONCORD will police PVP actions taken by Capsuleers, responses are delayed depending on the security rating of the system in question, nearly instant in 1.0 space and nearly 20 seconds in 0.5 space. While this is intended to be an indication of danger, the only truly safe place in New Eden is docked, so remember to practice caution regardless of this value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD will only police specific actions called Criminal-Level Offenses, which give a Capsuleer the Criminal Status, CONCORD ships and nearby sentry guns will fire on Criminal Capsuleers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following is a list of offenses that provide the Criminal status in High-Sec&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleer that is not a Legal Target&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking CONCORD&lt;br /&gt;
* Attacking another Capsuleers loot&lt;br /&gt;
* Remote repairing NPC or Capsuleer Criminal ships&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction here is the &amp;quot;Legal&amp;quot; target, which makes a world of difference to how safe High-Sec actually is for members of Signal Cartel. A Criminal or Suspect Capsuleer is a legal target, and CONCORD will not intervene if a Capsuleer aggresses against them. War is another reason that a target would be considered legal, members of warring Corporations are considered Legal Targets to each other. If a Legal Target is attacked they gain the Limited Engagement status which allows them to defend themselves against their aggressor without interference by CONCORD. Another source of the Limited Engagement status is when two Capsuleers accept a Duel Request, allowing them to fight without interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While these are the CONCORD laws and standards, members of Signal Cartel are expected to uphold [[The Credo]] and remain neutral in our actions. Just because CONCORD will not respond to an action, doesn&#039;t mean it is in line with The Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that CONCORD is only present as a deterrent to criminal activity in High-Sec and will not protect you. Other Capsuleer Corps have often declared war on Signal Cartel and are free to attack our ships regardless of status, including in High-Sec space, combined with low returns from high-sec exploration sites this means that High-Sec space provides much less in the way of exploration opportunities than Null-Sec or J-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Lowsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.4 and 0.1 are considered Low-Sec. In Lowsec, like Hisec, there are CONCORD sentry guns on stations and stargates, however, CONCORD will not react to hostile PVP actions, though the sentry guns will attack provoking players and such actions will still cause a loss of Security Status. Low-Sec is just as dangerous as Hi-sec but for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Lowsec is far less populated than Hisec people there will often specifically hunt you down, without any fear of concord showing up. Lowsec systems that act as chokepoints bordering Hisec or Nullsec are often used to Gate Camp, resulting in many ship losses when moving in and out of Lowsec. The safest method in and out of Lowsec for an experienced explorer is through Wormhole space, however, this requires its own set of skills to be done effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lower population of Lowsec means that worthwhile sites in empty systems are far more common, likewise, the sites themselves provide much better payouts than Hisec variants, though they often tend to have cans that are harder to hack. It is important to learn how to use D-Scan and Local to protect yourself, and to practice risk assessment at all times; determining when it&#039;s &amp;quot;Safe Enough&amp;quot;, when to cut your losses or quit while you&#039;re ahead. The greatest tool would be experience and making mistakes, you&#039;ll likely never forget the situations that got you blown up and you&#039;ll learn from them. Try to use cheaper, disposable, ships at first to get used to the feeling and to mitigate any anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Faction Warfare Space==&lt;br /&gt;
Faction Warfare as a gameplay mechanic does not really affect Signaleers, as being in Signal Cartel precludes us from participating. Faction Warfare takes place in Low-Sec space, specifically in two regional War Zones, each of which is being contested by two NPC factions: The Amarr-Minmatar war zone, and the Caldari-Gallente war zone. Players aid their chosen faction in contesting these systems for faction standings and loyalty points, and count as being at war with their opposing faction, allowing them to legally attack each other in High-Sec space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Nullsec=&lt;br /&gt;
The security of a system is an indication of roughly how dangerous that system may be, displayed as a decimal value between 1.0 and -1.0, Systems with a security rating of between 0.3 and 0.0 are considered Null-Sec. In Null-Sec, unlike in Hi-Sec or Low-Sec, there is no Concord presence or acts that provide the criminal or suspicious status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No ship or module restrictions apply in Null Space and situational awareness is key to surviving Null-Sec. Keep an eye out for gate camps and fleets of hunters, and remain mobile or cloaked when possible. Always trust your gut when you feel things are a little too unsafe and simply move on. Try not to fly anything you couldn&#039;t afford to lose in Null and practice effective risk management when it comes to deciding when to return to a station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On top of the usual safe travel technics, you&#039;ll need extra measures specifically in Null-Sec. For instance, gate camps will use &amp;quot;bubbles&amp;quot;. Mobile Warp Disruptors, Warp Disrupt Probes, and Warp Disruption Field Generator will be deployed at specific gates and will require specific defensive modules (nullification module) or tactics (warp to the gate at an angle, not from another gate). The locals know their space well and will have scouts to warn them in advance while you are still two or three jumps away, many PVP corps present in Null Space have standing fleets intended to chase out or down trespassers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all these risks, Null-Sec offers the most relative freedom and possible rewards of known space for exploration, and despite how overwhelming these risks may sound correct mitigation can nearly guarantee survival. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Choosing a Region==&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you are exploring to find hacking sites you will need a quiet area with profitable sites and an easy way in / easy way out. Different regions of Null are occupied by specific Pirate Factions, each of which has unique loot tables for their data and relic sites. The average value of each faction in order of most to least isk per site is as follows: Sansha&#039;s Nation, Gurista&#039;s Pirates, Blood Raider Covenant, Angel Cartel, Serpentis Corporation. Though this can change based on the current economy. You can use various sites like EvEye and DotLan maps to find out which regions of null are inhabited by your chosen faction, but remember that the more valuable of a faction you choose the more competition you are likely to find. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Null Sec is divided into Claimable and NPC regions, in Claimable Null you will find capsuleer corps and stations being run, from which there are most likely standing fleets and you are unlikely to be allowed to dock, while in NPC Null you will find NPC Stations that are generally safe to dock at so long as you do not have poor standing with the pirate faction of said region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Entering Null sec==&lt;br /&gt;
The first issue of Null-Sec is simply finding a reliable method of accessing it. The various alliances and factions - even small gangs of independant pilots - will set gate camps at the choke points. Even if it is possible to reach Null space using the regular travel routes, there are much safer ways to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Filaments:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Filaments are fairly cheap consumable items found in data-sites, the two kinds useful for this purpose are &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot;. To use a filament you must be in a fleet (Even if it is simply by yourself), have your ship safety setting set to at least Partial Safety, and not have any log-out timers. You must also be a certain distance from structures, simply warp at 100 to a nearby celestial object or use a safe point. When attempting to use a Filament you may find it a tad finicky, so long as you meet these requirements simply try a couple more times and it should work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These filaments are named as &amp;quot;(Noise/Signal)-# &#039;Needlejack&#039; Filament&amp;quot; the # determines how many nearby fleet ships the filament is capable of transporting, while the &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; determines how the filament targets systems, With Noise being seemingly random space and Signal targeting systems with high &amp;quot;Activity&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a catch to filaments: while theoretically Noise filaments will go to a random null system, the exact methodology of its targeting is unknown. Many have claimed to find patterns in where it will put you in short periods of time, or repeated locations being used, and there have been some claims of gate camps or hunters that specifically use this knowledge to hunt down filamenters. Though there isn&#039;t much in the way of hard evidence on the subject, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g995rk/needlejack_filamenting_a_guide_of_sorts/this Reddit post studying the Needlejacks use] leads to this conclusion. On the other hand, there are a lot of examples of successful pilots roaming in Null Sec using filaments. This tactic should probably not be discarded lightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is a unique system and offers a lot of opportunities to travel across New Eden. Signal Cartel - and more specifically the Eve Scout program - are heavily related to Thera and any Signaleer should probably get familiar with it. Suitonia, a famous Eve Online PVPer, made [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxj9ceC5v4 a good introductory video here]. Regarding the access to Null Sec, Thera is definitely a valid option, especially if you have decided to live out of Signal Cartel&#039;s Thera Station. A famous Signaleer [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/9263/exploring-in-nullsec-long/17 explained how to use Thera to access Null Sec].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic is not without risks either, thanks to the Eve Scout program, there is a public list of currently opened wormholes in Thera and their destination. This is very useful to the Eve Online community, however, the trade-off is that any Null sec group could be waiting for you on arrival as they can check the current wormholes state on the Eve Scout Website, they may be waiting two or three jumps away. Remember that Null-Sec Capsuleers are very familiar with each of their limited territories, while you must become familiar as you move and plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Thera section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;- Using random wormholes&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tactic could be qualified as a &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; approach. To summarize, you scan a random wormhole close to where you are, and enter it. You enter another wormhole and continue following the chain until you find a suitable null connection, or dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of this method is that no one should be waiting for you, it&#039;s unlikely your specific chain has been mapped out and camped as long as it doesn&#039;t border a high-traffic system. However because of the unpredictable nature of these connections the resulting Null connection, should it even exist, may be sub-standard. There may be high traffic, or a poor yield NPC faction, or perhaps even some sort of conflict. You may scan during hours without finding a valid Null sec exit point or continuously find dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would like to use this method you should also look at the Wormholes section of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=Pochven=&lt;br /&gt;
=Wormhole Space/J-Space=&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole Space, also known as J-Space or Anoikis Space, is a unique collection of around 2600 systems that contain no stargates making them only accessible via Wormhole. J-Space Systems are named with a J- followed by 6 numbers and do not contain NPC Stations. High, Low, and Null Sec Space, when in reference to J-Space, is called Known Space or K-Space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Local Chat in Wormhole Space is different from K-Space as it does not show Capsuleers present in the system unless they are actively using it. D-Scan still functions as normal, allowing you to see uncloaked Capsuleers, but any wormhole could contain any number of cloaked capsuleers without your knowledge, thus it is imperative that you remain alert in Wormhole Space. Many use the one-click one-scan rule, that for every time you click something you should D-Scan. Thankfully this also means that cloaked Signaleers at safe spots are nearly impossible to find, or even notice for that matter, thus you are most vulnerable while caching, hacking a site, or leaving the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastered, however, Wormhole Space is particularly useful for explorers and contains the majority of Signal Cartel content such as [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)|The ESRC Program]], [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]], and even [[AD:Anoikis_Division|The Anoikis Division]]. Other than Signal Cartel services, Wormhole Space is uniquely valuable to explorers as it contains a higher density of sites than Known Space, has random paths that continuously change, making Capsuleer Density low, allows for better hunter avoidance, and provides more valuable exploration sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Finding Wormholes==&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn randomly in any system and decay within a couple of days, making their various connections and locations exceptionally random, logging out in a Wormhole is both a good way to lose your path back to known space and to find new systems in the chain. Wormholes can spawn anywhere and can lead to anywhere, from J-Space to K-Space, K-Space to K-Space, J-Space to J-Space, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormholes spawn appear as Signatures just like Data and Relic sites, most wormholes can be easily scanned down by a starter exploration fit, and all wormholes can be entered by frigates, some can have size restrictions beyond this. Once a wormhole is scanned down it can be warped to and entered. Once you have warped to a Wormhole you are most likely going to want to identify it. How long it will last, if other ships have traveled through it, where it will go, and if your ship will fit through it this is the kind of information you&#039;ll be wanting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a variety of methods of identifying wormholes, from simply inspecting the details of them to looking at their color and shape. Though it can seem daunting at first, As you gain experience with wormholes you&#039;ll find them more and more simple to identify. Make sure to D-scan near a chosen wormhole to ensure it isn&#039;t being camped, and remain alert whilst identifying it, camped wormholes are rare but dangerous, and become far more common with High-Sec connections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Identification==&lt;br /&gt;
===Show Info===&lt;br /&gt;
The most straightforward method of identifying wormholes is simply selecting one on grid and clicking &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot;. A window will appear giving you information about the wormhole in 4 sentences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The first indicates what parts of space it would seem to lead to, there are more accurate ways to determine the destination, such as distinguishing between C1/C2/C3 wormholes or even determining what region of known space it connects to, however this is the simplest.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! System Type&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Unknown || C1/C2/C3&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Dangerous Unknown || C4/C5&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Deadly Unknown || C6&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| High Security || Hisec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Low Security || Lowsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Null Security || Nullsec&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Triglavian Space || Pochven&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thera System || Thera&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second indicates what stage of life the wormhole is currently at, while there are 4 different possibilities players generally split it into &amp;quot;Fresh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End of Life&amp;quot; (Or EOL) with EOL referring to a wormhole with less than 4 hours remaining. It is not suggested to enter end of life wormholes if you want to return the way you came as it is very easy to become trapped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Remaining Time&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet begun || more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || Between 4 and 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || Less than 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| dissipating into the ether || unverified, potentially less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. The third indicates how much mass has destabilized this wormhole so far. Everything has mass including your ship and its contents, and every type of wormhole has different mass limits, any mass passing through a wormhole incrementally destabilizes it, until it reaches its limits. Some wormholes have very small mass limits, some very large, some even regenerate stability over time. This won&#039;t tell you a number, just how much in comparison to the wormholes max that has passed through, wormholes that are very unstable from mass are likely being &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; where someone goes back and forth through a wormhole to force it to close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Mass to Limit Ratio&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| not yet had its stability significantly disrupted || less than 50%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| beginning to decay || between 50% and 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| reaching the end || more than 90%&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. The last indicates what size ships can enter this wormhole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Description !! Ship Limits&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Very large ships || Everything except for Titans and Supercarriers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Larger ships || Battleships, Orcas, and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Up to medium size ships || Unplated Nestors, Battlecruisers and smaller&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Only the smallest ships || Frigates, destroyers, and certain Heavy Interdiction Cruiser fits&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The visual aspect of a wormhole provides information that enable a pilot to complete the &amp;quot;show info&amp;quot; details, which is particularly interresting when looking at an exit (K162). To do that, one has to look at the two parts of the hole : its &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; (the wobbly bubble in the center) and its aurora (its arms) :&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WH parts.png|thumb|center|Wormhole Parts]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
====Destination system====&lt;br /&gt;
This information can be gathered when looking at the eye of the wormhole. The eye of the wormhole reflects the landscape of the region you&#039;ll end in when jumping through. Here are their various aspects and a few additional clues to know what to look for when you look a wormhole in its eye !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=====Jumping to K-Space=====&lt;br /&gt;
======High-Sec and Low-Sec======&lt;br /&gt;
As the eye is a reflection of the skybox of the system you&#039;ll land in, when jumping to High-sec or Low-Sec, its color will hint at the empire ruling the system.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
====Health of the wormhole====&lt;br /&gt;
=====End of Life=====&lt;br /&gt;
As the wormhole ages, its aurora will fade and its movements will slow down and the eye become &amp;quot;wobblier&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Fading.png|center|700px|Two size L wormhole : one healthy, the other reaching its end of life.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=====Mass destabilization=====&lt;br /&gt;
As ships jump through, the size of the eye will shrink. Unfortunately, in empty space, there is no object of reference to compare the size of the eye to, so this is very hard to spot. &lt;br /&gt;
It is generally visible if witnessing the moment when the size changes as a ship goes through and the wormhole&#039;s information is the quickest source of information available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if you use the &amp;quot;Look At&amp;quot; function when you select the wormhole in your overview, you&#039;ll set your point of view at a fixed distance and then you&#039;ll be able to notice how unusually small the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; of the wormhole appears to be on your screen as long, as you do not zoom in or out.&lt;br /&gt;

==Thera==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is the largest system in Anoikis. It has a unique distinction of being the only wormhole system with NPC stations owned by The Sanctuary corporation, a research branch of Servant Sisters of EVE.  One of those stations, [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Thera_XII_-_The_Sanctuary_Institute_of_Paleocybernetics The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics], located near Thera XII planet hosts Signal Cartel headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thera is highly connected to known space and can be used by adventurous or well-prepared pilots as a shortcut for traveling between New Eden regions. Signal Cartel&#039;s [[TS:Thera Scanning|Thera Scanning]] service maintains a [http://www.eve-scout.com/ map] of wormhole connections to Thera which can be used to plan the route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several landmarks that have remnants of space constructions abandoned by previous Thera explorers. An activated CovOps cloaking device is recommended for sightseers who want to visit them as those sites are patrolled by Sleeper vessels.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Welcome to the Exploration Adopt-A-Page Initiative&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Explorer&#039;s Compendium Needs You!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a goal of making The Explorer’s Compendium the best exploration resource in the Universe, but we need your help to make this dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== What is Adopt-A-Page? ==&lt;br /&gt;
* The Exploration Adopt-A-Page Initiative is modeled after the real life [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adopt-a-Highway Adopt-A-Highway] litter control program, in which volunteers pledge to keep a section of road free from litter.  In exchange for this service, the individual or group has their name displayed on the particular section of road they maintain.&lt;br /&gt;
* In this same manner, Signaleers can &amp;quot;adopt&amp;quot; an exploration page on our wiki.  &lt;br /&gt;
* &#039;&#039;&#039;By adopting a page, Signaleers pledge to edit the page and build it out to completion within 3 months from the adoption date.&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* In exchange, the newly minted wiki editor will get their name and picture in a banner at the top of their adopted page for a 3-month period.   &lt;br /&gt;
* After 3 months, assuming the page is properly fleshed out, the wiki editor that adopted the page will then receive recognition at the bottom of their page - &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;forever acknowledging their awesome contribution to our shared knowledge&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;!&lt;br /&gt;
* It&#039;s our hope that this initiative will spark further interest in the wiki and therefore our ability to sustain continued growth.  The ultimate goal is to make The Explorer’s Compendium the best exploration resource in the Universe!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Example Banner &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;(imagine, your name in lights! - well, at least in a banner)&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; ==&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!----&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== How to Edit the Wiki ==&lt;br /&gt;
* The skills needed to edit a wiki page are pretty minimal - if you can read and type, you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;
* Please read and familiarize yourself with our [[Wiki_Editing_Guidelines | Wiki Editing Guidelines]].&lt;br /&gt;
* A basic understanding of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext Wiki Markup] is helpful. &lt;br /&gt;
* This [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet Cheatsheet] is useful to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;
* Also, please cite your sources and give credit where credit is due - please no plagiarizing!  Click [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/UniWiki:Editing_Guide#References here] for more information about using references.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== What If I&#039;m a New Player or Not an Exploration Expert (yet)? ==&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s completely fine!  Please still sign up and participate!  This is meant to be fun and will also be a great learning experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Some suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;

** Dig through the old [https://forums.eve-scout.com/ EvE-Scout Forums] and our [https://discord.gg/0qn6aJxK8iwEfiwF Discord Server] (there is a wealth of information just waiting to be uncovered)&lt;br /&gt;
