== The Beginnings ==

The story of Signal Cartel cannot be told without first talking about [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera Thera].  Thera was introduced to EVE Online with the [https://community.eveonline.com/releases/rhea Rhea] expansion on December 9th, 2014.  The impending launch of Thera was the catalyst that led [https://evewho.com/character/95158478 Johnny Splunk] and [https://evewho.com/character/95142600 G8keeper] to co-found [https://evewho.com/corporation/98361601 EvE-Scout] as a neutral service corporation tasked with publicly documenting the ever-changing wormhole connections to and from this hub system. As a result, [http://www.eve-scout.com/ eve-scout.com] was born which provides a live updated listing of all wormhole connections to Thera.&lt;ref name="Live Updated Thera Connections">[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2p4eac/live_updated_thera_connections_we_scan_so_you/ Live updated Thera Connections We scan so you don't have to EvE-Scout]&lt;/ref> According to Johnny, "I still remember the first time I traversed into Thera and the following week of maintaining the connections in Thera with our co-founder G8keeper. We would take shifts between sleeping, real life, and scanning Thera. It was stressful and exhilarating: some of the best parts of EVE!"&lt;ref name="SOTS #12">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/4990/state-of-the-signal-12 State of the Signal #12]&lt;/ref>

However, Johnny and G8keeper soon realized that the endeavor was not sustainable with just two of them.  Fortunately, volunteers from the greater EVE community were eager to help scan Thera's wormholes as scouts.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018">[https://www.talkinginstations.com/2018/04/tis-04-08-18-signal-cartel/ Signal Cartel, Talking in Stations]&lt;/ref> In an effort to maintain the corp's neutrality, the original Thera scouts were not permitted to join EvE-Scout. Johnny stated, "When we launched the Thera scanning project we wanted to provide neutral information to all of New Eden. Not to favor one group over another. Our scouts were not even able to join our corporation (EvE-Scout). We only accepted out-of-corp scouts. The reason was we could disavow our scout's other activities and while at the same time allow us to attract scouts without them leaving their existing corp."&lt;ref name="Johnny">[https://www.reddit.com/r/signalcartel/comments/348y3g/anoikis_division/ Johnny on Signal Cartel Subreddit]&lt;/ref> Due to EvE-Scout's dedicated and trusted scout team, the service became the de facto source of Thera wormhole connection information. &lt;ref name="Live Updated Thera Connections">[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2p4eac/live_updated_thera_connections_we_scan_so_you/ Live updated Thera Connections We scan so you don't have to EvE-Scout]&lt;/ref>

== Formation of Signal Cartel ==

As one would expect, a lot of the original out-of-corp Thera scouts were also explorers.&lt;ref name="Hydrostatic Podcast HP23">[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BybQUQ0NeVp_b1VSSXNnY0pIalk/view?usp=sharing&amp;resourcekey=0-5861x95BD2h0AbtYN9yzSw Hydrostatic Podcast HP23 Something New to Do]&lt;/ref> As exploration is a mostly solitary affair, these scouts wanted to create more of a community with an identity centered on scanning and exploration.  Thus, the idea for a new player corporation was formed.&lt;ref name="New Capsuleers Welcome">[https://evenews24.com/2019/01/17/new-capsuleers-welcome-explore-new-eden-with-signal-cartel/ New Capsuleers Welcome: Explore New Eden with Signal Cartel]&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" /> While Johnny and G8keeper were supportive, they were busy expanding EvE-Scout's Thera Scanning service and knew they would need someone else to run the new corporation.  However, from the start, they had a strong opinion about what the corp should look like.  They wanted the corp to be neutral to all, counter-culture in ideology, and of course exploration-centric.&lt;ref name="EVE Vegas">[https://youtu.be/y1x5DXdQ0wg EVE Vegas 2016]&lt;/ref> Johnny stated, "When G8keeper and I founded EvE-Scout we did not set forth to create a player corporation such as Signal Cartel. Certainly we talked about how a corporation might fit in, but at the end of the day we both knew there was no way the two of us could successfully run a corporation and the service at the same time. The only way something would work is if it met three basic requirements: that it synergized with our future goals, that it would not diminish our neutral standing in New Eden, that someone else ran the day-to-day."&lt;ref name="Johnny">[https://www.reddit.com/r/signalcartel/comments/348y3g/anoikis_division/ Johnny on Signal Cartel Subreddit]&lt;/ref>
      
Fortunately, [https://evewho.com/character/1252841503 Mynxee] was there to answer the call as one of the first Thera scouts having recently returned to the game as an explorer after gaining infamy as the founder and leader of the [https://www.pcgamer.com/the-life-and-death-of-eve-onlines-first-all-woman-pirate-gang/ Hellcats] and fame as a [https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/csm5-election-the-results-are-in CSM5] (2010) member&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" />&lt;ref name="Another Exciting Sandcastle">[http://cloakywanderer.blogspot.com/2015/01/another-exciting-sandcastle.html Another Exciting Sandcastle]&lt;/ref>.  She stood out early as most leaders do, but initially Johnny and G8keeper had no idea about her (in)famous past.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" />&lt;ref name="Hydrostatic Podcast HP23" /> Upon learning about it, Johnny had no issues with making a former pirate Signal Cartel's first CEO, however G8keeper had reservations. In a twist of fate, Katia Sae (yes, that Katia Sae!) happened to have [https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Public:Katia34_Explorer_Mynxee interviewed Mynxee on their blog] in December of 2014.  Johnny ran across this article and shared it with G8keeper, which wholeheartedly convinced them that Mynxee was the right candidate for CEO.&lt;ref name="EVE Vegas" /> In retrospect, Mynxee's ex-pirate presence lent the fledging group credibility within the harshness of EVE.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" /> 

According to Mynxee, "Soon after my arrival in Thera, I started scouting for them. We began talking about exploration as a career and what a fine thing it would be to create a home, a haven, for explorers who just want to wander between the stars on their own agenda. Much talking later, Signal Cartel was born: a corp devoted to the highest ideals of exploration, nurturing to new players, and many other things besides that are practically foreign in New Eden culture."&lt;ref name="Another Exciting Sandcastle" />

Signal Cartel was co-founded on January 20th, 2015 by Johnny Splunk, G8keeper, and Mynxee with Mynxee serving as the first CEO.  The corporation officially opened to the public on January 31st 2015.&lt;ref name="Happy Third Birthday" /> Of the original Signal Cartel members to join the corp on the opening day, the oldest active member is [https://evewho.com/character/885864009 Katia Sae], our current Alliance Executor.  Thus, only Johnny and Mynxee have more seniority.&lt;ref name="Sagan Four Years">[https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Public:Katia76_SC_Four_Years Signal Cartel Celebrating Four years]&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="Katia" />

== The Credo ==
Presciently, prior to the formation of Signal Cartel, Johnny and G8keeper recognized the unique opportunity to start with a clean slate and to incorporate ideals they wanted to see become manifest in the new corporation.&lt;ref name="Johnny" /> In the beginning, G8keeper worried more about logistics and the organizational structure, while Johnny concentrated on what the new corporation would look like and how it would feel.  Due to Johnny's past experiences with other EVE corporations, he wanted to experiment and to try something different compared to the EVE norm.  This led him to write the original bullet points that became the framework for the Credo. Johnny then gave the bullet points to Mynxee who fleshed them out to their current form.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" /> After further minor refinements between the three of them, [[Policy:The_Credo|our Credo]] was born which has remained largely unchanged.&lt;ref name="Hydrostatic Podcast HP23" />&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" /> The Credo aims to be actionable with expectations clearly defined while still allowing for personal interpretation of its scope.  The hope is for Signal Cartel members to internalize the spirit and intent of the Credo and use that to guide their conduct rather than having to adhere to a strict set of rules and acting like drones.&lt;ref name="EVE Vegas">[https://youtu.be/y1x5DXdQ0wg EVE Vegas 2016]&lt;/ref> According to Johnny, "the Credo's main purpose is to help the alliance and service maintain a neutral standing in New Eden. It was also tailored to align with the spirit of traditional explorers. Finally we wanted to have a community that we actually enjoyed being a part of."&lt;ref name="Johnny" /> Thus, Signal Cartel's corp culture has been shaped from the beginning by the Credo.

[https://evewho.com/character/96079190 Thrice Hapus], Signal Cartel's eventual second CEO, had a very good take on the Credo.  He basically said that the first sentence of the Credo is really all you need. "Signal Cartel is a service corporation to all of New Eden." All the subsequent details aren't really necessary as long as you get the spirit and intent of the Credo.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" />

== Mission Statement ==
Mynxee states, "[...]the mission of Signal Cartel is to embrace and promote exploration as a career choice, to provide a haven and home for explorers, to help new players fall in love with New Eden through the lens of exploration, and to provide useful services to all of New Eden through our membership in the Eve-Scout Enclave alliance. All in a corp with a culture of neutrality, respectfulness, non-aggressive behavior, generosity of spirit, helpfulness, and friendliness to all. Such things are antithesis to many EvE corp cultures but we believe that there are a lot of players out there with an explorer's heart who will embrace just such a culture with enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="Another Exciting Sandcastle" />

=== EvE-Scout Rescue Division ===
From
In early YC118 (2016), Signal Cartel member Forcha Alendare had a vision of a service that would provide a basic emergency resource kit for capsuleers stranded in wormholes, regardless of alliance, sovereignty, or play style. This vision captured the imagination of many Signal Cartel pilots and grew to become the Rescue Cache program we know today.

In late YC118 (2016), Forcha decided to move on to activities that would potentially bring him into conflict with the Credo, so he chose to leave the corporation and alliance leadership brought in Thrice Hapus to manage day-to-day operations.

Since then, the program has grown to become an entire division within Signal Cartel and encompasses both live Search and Rescue operations as well as the original Rescue Cache program. 

When Thrice Hapus became CEO of Signal Cartel, Igaze took over EvE Scout Rescue and guided the division from December YC120 (2018) until April YC123 (2021). Under his watch the division set many new records for number of rescues, caches in space, and 911 call volume. Then in YC123 (2021), Captain Crinkle, one of our most experienced rescue pilots, took the helm. Crinkle guided the division until May of YC124 (2022) when our current ESRC Manager, Xalyar assumed the lead role. While he oversees the division as a whole, it takes an entire team to make it all happen. Source: https://evescoutrescue.com/home/about.php

== Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Signal Cartel (but were afraid to ask) ==
As I write the history of Signal Cartel, dozens of potentially interesting questions pop in and out of my head that I am curious to know the answer to.  Over the course of researching our corp's history, I am collecting them below along with the answers from the best available sources.  Enjoy! - Vega Blazar

* How does EvE-Scout relate to Signal Cartel?
**Thrice Hapus summarized the relationship nicely, "The corp/alliance distinction can be confusing, since we are all sort of jumbled up together. The [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Org_Chart|org chart]] may be helpful to you. The distinction is primarily a practical one. Before Signal Cartel existed, there was a group of folks under Johnny-Splunk's leadership scanning Thera connections and sharing them with the community at-large. These pilots were not part of the same corp, but they did fly with the same mission. Eventually this group grew and wanted its own identity. Thus was born Signal Cartel. For logistical reasons, the EvE-Scout corp was retained solely as the executor of the EvE-Scout Enclave alliance, which consisted of EvE-Scout (for alliance leadership only) and Signal Cartel (for everyone else). The EvE-Scout Logistics corp came along later to help keep bookkeeping sorted."&lt;ref name="Identity, Symbols, and History">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/3933/identity-symbols-and-history EvE-Scout Forums - Identity, Symbols, and History]&lt;/ref>
* Who wrote the Credo?
**Johnny Splunk wrote the original bullet points that became the framework for the Credo. He then gave the bullet points to Mynxee who fleshed them out to their current form.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" /> After further minor refinements between Johnny, Mynxee, and G8keeper, [[Policy:The_Credo|our Credo]] was born which has remained largely unchanged.&lt;ref name="Hydrostatic Podcast HP23" />&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" />
* Did you know that at one time, EvE-Scout Enclave alliance included an additional corporation?
** The alliance member was called: Anoikis Nomads and was headed by Aiken Paru and his alts.  The purpose of the corporation was "to truly explore wormhole space without the constraints of a POS or any ties to empire space".  source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/signalcartel/comments/4cerav/new_alliance_member_anoikis_nomads/ New Alliance Member: Anoikis Nomads]
* Who came up with "We Scan So You Don't Have To"?
** Johnny Splunk used this slogan for EvE-Scout when advertising the Thera scanning service under the username eve-scout on reddit.&lt;ref name="Live Updated Thera Connections">[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2p4eac/live_updated_thera_connections_we_scan_so_you/ Live updated Thera Connections We scan so you don't have to EvE-Scout]&lt;/ref>
* Where did the saying "Can't Stop the Signal" originate?
** The saying originates from ''Serenity'' (a 2005 film) by Joss Whedon based on the TV show ''Firefly''.  Katia Sae used it as a [https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Public:Katia37_Cant_Stop_the_Signal blog post title] and twitter hashtag, and it caught on from there.&lt;ref name="Katia" />&lt;ref name="SOTS #1">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/469/state-of-the-signal-1 State of the Signal #1]&lt;/ref>
* How did the corp mantra "Be the content you want to see in Signal" take root?
** "Things in Signal are purposely left up to Signaleers to make happen. Johnny and I decided from the outset that we didn't want to be solely responsible as content generators. 'Be the content you want to see in Signal' is sort of our mantra." - Mynxee&lt;ref name="Finding my place">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/830/finding-my-place-in-the-corp Finding my place in the corp]&lt;/ref>
* How did a former space pirate become our first CEO?
**  Johnny Splunk was heavily considering Mynxee for the position due to her work in Thera with Eve-Scout, but G8keeper had reservations about her prior career as a pirate.  Fortuitously, [https://www.saganexplorations.net/?p=386 Katia Sae interviewed Mynxee on their blog].  Johnny ran across this article and shared it with G8keeper, which convinced them that Mynxee was the right candidate for CEO (sources r/signalcartel and EVE Vegas presentation).
* Why can't we pod people after they attack us first?
** "If someone attacks you and you destroy their ship, that’s self-defense and is permitted by the Credo. But podding anyone is a BIG FAT NOPE regardless of circumstances. Pods can’t hurt you, so don’t target that pod..." - Mynxee&lt;ref name="SOTS #10">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/2415/state-of-the-signal-10 State of the Signal #10]&lt;/ref>

* Why does Signal Cartel intentionally make itself eligible for wars?
** From Johnny, Mynxee, and Thrice:  "Our official stance regarding wardec eligibility is simple: we keep structures anchored in the alliance specifically so that we remain eligible for wars, thus discouraging activities outside of exploration for our members. We are first and foremost an exploration corp. We will continue to regard an active wardec as an opportunity to hone our piloting skills, and we will carry on as before."&lt;ref name="War Dec">[[Policy:War_Dec_Eligibility|Policy:War Dec Eligibility]]&lt;/ref>
* What are "Hugs", who started "Hugging", how do you "Hug" someone, what is a "Hugs Fleet"?
** When Signal Cartel was first wardecced, early Leadership didn't know how to address wardecs on a corporate level.  Using the Credo as a guide, Hugs Fleets were created by Johnny Splunk as a wartime doctrine to engage productively with the wardeccers instead of hiding or avoiding them.  Hugs Fleets take the love to our wardeccers in a fun Credo-compliant manner.  The earliest Hugs Fleets consisted of Griffins armed with festival launchers, fireworks, snowballs, and ECM modules. According to Mynxee, "...basically, we just go engage with them and jam them, so they can't kill us, and then shoot them with fireworks and snowballs and have fun. And...engage in lighthearted chat in local".&lt;ref name="EVE Vegas">[https://youtu.be/y1x5DXdQ0wg EVE Vegas 2016]&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="Intro to SC">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncVBIbIG3FM Intro to Signal Cartel, EVE University Lecture]&lt;/ref>
* What is the purpose of Hugs Fleets? (it is not to suffer losses or to "troll" our wardeccers.)
** Have a good time.
** Teach the fundamentals of fleet operations to those who have never been in a fleet before.
** Give fleet experience in differing situations where possible; not every Hugs Fleet is the same.
** Teach newer members/players that wars don't have to be feared.
** Take the opportunity to show our wardeccers some respectful fun.
** Show New Eden that we take our Credo seriously and give no tears.&lt;ref name="Hugs Fleets">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/311/the-point-of-hugs-fleets The Point of Hugs Fleets]&lt;/ref>
* Is it "Hugs Fleet" or "Hug Fleet"?  Which is correct?
** Mynxee and Johnny Splunk always called them "Hugs Fleets".  The idea is that each snowball or firework shot at somebody is one "hug" and in a fleet there would be many "hugs" offered at once.&lt;ref name="Mynxee" />
* What is a Surprise Party?

*** Dungeon Manager - "The Credo, and our devotion to it’s peaceful tenets, gives us Signaleers an extra level of tank beyond the Shields, Armor and Hull other capsuleers use. It’s our Reputation tank."&lt;ref name="Amp 28" />
*** Mynxee - "It is a gift, not an entitlement and is not something anyone flying in Signal Cartel should ever expect or demand. Its source is our reputation, so do your part to uphold that reputation and perhaps you will be so lucky as to enjoy the occasional benefits of our somewhat fickle reputation tank. I personally prefer that just as with any gift, we accept it in good grace when offered and otherwise have no expectations of receiving it nor make any attempt to parley with or for it."&lt;ref name="Amp 28">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/3682/the-signal-amplifier-episode-28-yc120-04-07 The Signal Amplifier: Episode 28 - YC120/04/07]&lt;/ref>
* Did you know that our corp name was one of roughly 90 candidates?
** Some of the discarded names that the original Leadership Team considered were: Scoutapalooza, Shadow Scouts, 1420 MHz (this suggestion from Johnny Splunk inspired our ticker), New Eden Orienteers, Therabears, Probe Posse, Frontier Navigators, Gagarin Society, Scout Mob, Scout Camp, Scout Club, Wayfarers Society, and Ninja Pathfinders!&lt;ref name="SOTS #11">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/post/34643 State of the Signal #11]&lt;/ref>

* Did you know that Signal Cartel has an official theme song?
** [https://soundcloud.com/luobote-kong/cant-stop-the-signal Can't Stop the Signal] - Our official theme song (composed by former member Luobote Kong)
