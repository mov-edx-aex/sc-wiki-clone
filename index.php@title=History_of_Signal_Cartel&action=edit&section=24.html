As I write the history of Signal Cartel, dozens of potentially interesting questions pop in and out of my head that I am curious to know the answer to.  Over the course of researching our corp's history, I am collecting them below along with the answers from the best available sources.  Enjoy! - Vega Blazar

* How does EvE-Scout relate to Signal Cartel?
**Thrice Hapus summarized the relationship nicely, "The corp/alliance distinction can be confusing, since we are all sort of jumbled up together. The [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Org_Chart|org chart]] may be helpful to you. The distinction is primarily a practical one. Before Signal Cartel existed, there was a group of folks under Johnny-Splunk's leadership scanning Thera connections and sharing them with the community at-large. These pilots were not part of the same corp, but they did fly with the same mission. Eventually this group grew and wanted its own identity. Thus was born Signal Cartel. For logistical reasons, the EvE-Scout corp was retained solely as the executor of the EvE-Scout Enclave alliance, which consisted of EvE-Scout (for alliance leadership only) and Signal Cartel (for everyone else). The EvE-Scout Logistics corp came along later to help keep bookkeeping sorted."&lt;ref name="Identity, Symbols, and History">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/3933/identity-symbols-and-history EvE-Scout Forums - Identity, Symbols, and History]&lt;/ref>
* Who wrote the Credo?
**Johnny Splunk wrote the original bullet points that became the framework for the Credo. He then gave the bullet points to Mynxee who fleshed them out to their current form.&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" /> After further minor refinements between Johnny, Mynxee, and G8keeper, [[Policy:The_Credo|our Credo]] was born which has remained largely unchanged.&lt;ref name="Hydrostatic Podcast HP23" />&lt;ref name="Talking in Stations - 8 April 2018" />
* Did you know that at one time, EvE-Scout Enclave alliance included an additional corporation?
** The alliance member was called: Anoikis Nomads and was headed by Aiken Paru and his alts.  The purpose of the corporation was "to truly explore wormhole space without the constraints of a POS or any ties to empire space".  source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/signalcartel/comments/4cerav/new_alliance_member_anoikis_nomads/ New Alliance Member: Anoikis Nomads]
* Who came up with "We Scan So You Don't Have To"?
** Johnny Splunk used this slogan for EvE-Scout when advertising the Thera scanning service under the username eve-scout on reddit.&lt;ref name="Live Updated Thera Connections">[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2p4eac/live_updated_thera_connections_we_scan_so_you/ Live updated Thera Connections We scan so you don't have to EvE-Scout]&lt;/ref>
* Where did the saying "Can't Stop the Signal" originate?
** The saying originates from ''Serenity'' (a 2005 film) by Joss Whedon based on the TV show ''Firefly''.  Katia Sae used it as a [https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Public:Katia37_Cant_Stop_the_Signal blog post title] and twitter hashtag, and it caught on from there.&lt;ref name="Katia" />&lt;ref name="SOTS #1">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/469/state-of-the-signal-1 State of the Signal #1]&lt;/ref>
* How did the corp mantra "Be the content you want to see in Signal" take root?
** "Things in Signal are purposely left up to Signaleers to make happen. Johnny and I decided from the outset that we didn't want to be solely responsible as content generators. 'Be the content you want to see in Signal' is sort of our mantra." - Mynxee&lt;ref name="Finding my place">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/830/finding-my-place-in-the-corp Finding my place in the corp]&lt;/ref>
* How did a former space pirate become our first CEO?
**  Johnny Splunk was heavily considering Mynxee for the position due to her work in Thera with Eve-Scout, but G8keeper had reservations about her prior career as a pirate.  Fortuitously, [https://www.saganexplorations.net/?p=386 Katia Sae interviewed Mynxee on their blog].  Johnny ran across this article and shared it with G8keeper, which convinced them that Mynxee was the right candidate for CEO (sources r/signalcartel and EVE Vegas presentation).
* Why can't we pod people after they attack us first?
** "If someone attacks you and you destroy their ship, that’s self-defense and is permitted by the Credo. But podding anyone is a BIG FAT NOPE regardless of circumstances. Pods can’t hurt you, so don’t target that pod..." - Mynxee&lt;ref name="SOTS #10">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/2415/state-of-the-signal-10 State of the Signal #10]&lt;/ref>
* Did you know that EvE-Scout Enclave used to hold SOV in a handful of null-sec systems?!
** EvE-Scout held in Querious:

* Are the logos for EvE-Scout and EvE-Scout Enclave the same?
* [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/342/primer-using-eve-scout-to-navigate-to-or-from-thera Why is Thera our HQ?]
** According to Helios Anduath (one of the original Signal Cartel Directors), Thera was chosen as the HQ because Signal Cartel is heavily involved with EvE-Scout, which is all about Thera.  Thera is also the explorer's paradise, which makes it a no-brainer.&lt;ref name="Hydrostatic Podcast HP23" />  This is supported by Mynxee, "Our HQ is listed as there because of the EvE-Scout scanning endeavor...".&lt;ref name="Finding my place" />
* Why are we in Zoohen?
** Mynxee stated that Zoohen was chosen because she liked the name, and it made her smile.  Also, she wanted it close to SOE agents for Signaleers who wanted to mission run (located in nearby Sheroo).&lt;ref name="Mynxee">Mynxee, personal communication with Vega Blazar&lt;/ref>
** As it turns out, Zoo offers a lot of other fortuitous advantages:
*** Cassandra Habalu pointed out that Zoohen (in Amarr space) is close to the borders of five different regions and only three jumps away from Gallente space.  Therefore, there is huge operational (and cultural) variety available within a short travel time.  Also, there are a lot of nearby EVE lore sites and landmarks to explore.&lt;ref name="Concord">[http://habalueve.blogspot.com/2016/07/concord-and-yulai-graveyards.html CONCORD and the Yulai Graveyards]&lt;/ref>
*** Other potential posited advantages are listed [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/7016/why-are-we-in-zoohen here].
* Why are we in Gelhan?
** Gelhan was chosen for its easy access to large areas of low sec and nearby access to null.&lt;ref name="Mynxee" />
* Why are we in Saisio?
** Saisio was chosen because it is Katia Sae's home system and her statue is there.&lt;ref name="Mynxee" /> The proximity to Jita is a plus.
* Did you know that Signal Cartel used to have an office in Malkalen?&lt;ref name="SOTS #4">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/472/state-of-the-signal-4 State of the Signal #4]&lt;/ref>
** According to Mynxee, the Malkalen office was set up by G8keeper as a convenience for buyback hauling. (EvE-Scout Logistics)&lt;ref name="Mynxee" />
* How were the particular stations within each system chosen to host our corporate offices?
** Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support was chosen as it is the only station in the system with clone bay facilities.&lt;ref name="Mynxee" />
** Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory was selected as a corp office because it had the least expensive rent in the system.&lt;ref name="Katia">Katia Sae, personal communication with Vega Blazar&lt;/ref>

** Yes, Cassandra Habalu wrote a RP-based, EVE lore-compliant background that explains how 'she' came to be a part of Signal Cartel.  You can find that story [http://habalueve.blogspot.co.uk/p/chronicle-on-origins-of-allison.html here].

** Read about this famous pet [https://www.saganexplorations.net/?p=2506233 here]!
* Why does Signal Cartel intentionally make itself eligible for wars?
** From Johnny, Mynxee, and Thrice:  "Our official stance regarding wardec eligibility is simple: we keep structures anchored in the alliance specifically so that we remain eligible for wars, thus discouraging activities outside of exploration for our members. We are first and foremost an exploration corp. We will continue to regard an active wardec as an opportunity to hone our piloting skills, and we will carry on as before."&lt;ref name="War Dec">[[Policy:War_Dec_Eligibility|Policy:War Dec Eligibility]]&lt;/ref>
* What are "Hugs", who started "Hugging", how do you "Hug" someone, what is a "Hugs Fleet"?
** When Signal Cartel was first wardecced, early Leadership didn't know how to address wardecs on a corporate level.  Using the Credo as a guide, Hugs Fleets were created by Johnny Splunk as a wartime doctrine to engage productively with the wardeccers instead of hiding or avoiding them.  Hugs Fleets take the love to our wardeccers in a fun Credo-compliant manner.  The earliest Hugs Fleets consisted of Griffins armed with festival launchers, fireworks, snowballs, and ECM modules. According to Mynxee, "...basically, we just go engage with them and jam them, so they can't kill us, and then shoot them with fireworks and snowballs and have fun. And...engage in lighthearted chat in local".&lt;ref name="EVE Vegas">[https://youtu.be/y1x5DXdQ0wg EVE Vegas 2016]&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="Intro to SC">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncVBIbIG3FM Intro to Signal Cartel, EVE University Lecture]&lt;/ref>
* What is the purpose of Hugs Fleets? (it is not to suffer losses or to "troll" our wardeccers.)
** Have a good time.
** Teach the fundamentals of fleet operations to those who have never been in a fleet before.
** Give fleet experience in differing situations where possible; not every Hugs Fleet is the same.
** Teach newer members/players that wars don't have to be feared.
** Take the opportunity to show our wardeccers some respectful fun.
** Show New Eden that we take our Credo seriously and give no tears.&lt;ref name="Hugs Fleets">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/311/the-point-of-hugs-fleets The Point of Hugs Fleets]&lt;/ref>
* Is it "Hugs Fleet" or "Hug Fleet"?  Which is correct?
** Mynxee and Johnny Splunk always called them "Hugs Fleets".  The idea is that each snowball or firework shot at somebody is one "hug" and in a fleet there would be many "hugs" offered at once.&lt;ref name="Mynxee" />
* What is a Surprise Party?
** A Blops Hugs Fleet, which uses a BlackOps Battleship to drop a Hugs Fleet onto an unsuspecting target.&lt;ref name="Intro to SC" />
* What is Signal Cartel's Reputation Tank?
** Here are a few thoughts from prominent Signaleers:
*** Dungeon Manager - "The Credo, and our devotion to it’s peaceful tenets, gives us Signaleers an extra level of tank beyond the Shields, Armor and Hull other capsuleers use. It’s our Reputation tank."&lt;ref name="Amp 28" />
*** Mynxee - "It is a gift, not an entitlement and is not something anyone flying in Signal Cartel should ever expect or demand. Its source is our reputation, so do your part to uphold that reputation and perhaps you will be so lucky as to enjoy the occasional benefits of our somewhat fickle reputation tank. I personally prefer that just as with any gift, we accept it in good grace when offered and otherwise have no expectations of receiving it nor make any attempt to parley with or for it."&lt;ref name="Amp 28">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/3682/the-signal-amplifier-episode-28-yc120-04-07 The Signal Amplifier: Episode 28 - YC120/04/07]&lt;/ref>
* Did you know that our corp name was one of roughly 90 candidates?
** Some of the discarded names that the original Leadership Team considered were: Scoutapalooza, Shadow Scouts, 1420 MHz (this suggestion from Johnny Splunk inspired our ticker), New Eden Orienteers, Therabears, Probe Posse, Frontier Navigators, Gagarin Society, Scout Mob, Scout Camp, Scout Club, Wayfarers Society, and Ninja Pathfinders!&lt;ref name="SOTS #11">[https://forums.eve-scout.com/post/34643 State of the Signal #11]&lt;/ref>
