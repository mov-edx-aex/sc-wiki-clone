&lt;div&gt;==Problem==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Undocking from Jita 4-4.png|thumb|Undocking area of Jita 4-4 is pretty busy]]&lt;br /&gt;
It is impossible for a pilot leaving a station to know whether there is anybody outside camping it or not. Undocking ships are invulnerable for 30 seconds. It is impossible to lock, damage or bump them. This gives their pilots some time to assess the situation and decide what to do next. It is possible to dock again if needed given that the ship is still within the docking area of the station (which is not the case for kickout stations). However, as soon as the timer ends or if a pilot performs any action other than docking or stopping, the ship becomes vulnerable. At this moment a pilot&amp;#039;s ship may get attacked and either be severely damaged or completely destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Solution==&lt;br /&gt;
The idea of instaundock bookmarks is to allow undocking ships to warp away from the station to a potentially safer area without spending time on alignment. When executed correctly it drastically reduces the chance of being damaged while trying to undock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Mechanics==&lt;br /&gt;
There are 2 game mechanics involved in this process: undocking from stations and warp jumps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every space station has 1 or more undocking areas used by ships to leave the station. Undocking ships spawn in a random point around one of these docks flying away from the station at speeds that may be considerably higher than their max velocity. The direction they are flying in is generally perpendicular to the dock with a random deviation of up to +/- 15° from the ideal perpendicular. It is worth noting that horizontal and vertical deviations are calculated separately, so the shape of all possible undocking vectors resembles a square pyramid. Such randomization reduces a chance of ships spawning at the same point and bumping into each other while undocking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;gallery mode=&amp;quot;packed&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
File:Undocking angles experiment.png|thumb|Undocking angles distribution experiment&lt;br /&gt;
File:Undock pyramid front.png|Approximate undocking angles pyramid&lt;br /&gt;
File:Undock pyramid side.png|Approximate undocking angles pyramid (side view)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/gallery&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for the warping part, there are 3 criteria which have to be met in order do a warp jump:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* The target destination has to be 150+ km away from the ship for it to be able to initiate a warp jump&lt;br /&gt;
* The ship has to move with 75%+ of its maximum velocity&lt;br /&gt;
* The ship has to move towards the destination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Warp angles deviation experiment.png|thumb|Warp angles deviation experiment]]&lt;br /&gt;
It is widely accepted and stated in various sources that a deviation of up to 5º from the destination is allowed (ref: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Advanced_piloting_techniques#Warp). However, according to empirical data acquired in Dec 2023 for the purpose of writing this article the max allowed deviation is approximately 7º and the shape of all possible deviation vectors resembles a cone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Usually instaundock bookmarks are pretty far from stations and ships are flying fast while undocking. So the only thing required for this mechanic to work is to ensure that your ship faces the bookmark. However since the alignment angle deviation cone is much smaller than the undock angle deviation pyramid it is impossible to create only 1 instaundock bookmark that will work all the time. There are 3 strategies pilots can use to mitigate this issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Repeat docking and undocking procedures until the vector is close enough to the bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
* Create a bookmark as close as possible to the ideal vector to reduce alignment times&lt;br /&gt;
* Create multiple bookmarks to increase a change of them being usable&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regardless of the strategy it is recommended to create instaundock bookmarks outside the station’s grid which is 8,000 km or more depending on the station. Doing so reduces the chance that campers will see where the ship eventually lands and predict its further trajectory. So it may buy you some time to align the ship to the next destination and safely warp away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Usage==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Using undock bookmarmk.png|thumb|Using an instaundock bookmark]]&lt;br /&gt;
In order to use an instaundock bookmark:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Click the Undock button and wait for the system to load&lt;br /&gt;
# Visually verify that your undocking vector is close enough to the bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
# Initiate warp if the vector is good enough&lt;br /&gt;
# Dock back to the station if the vector is too far from the bookmark and try again until you get it good enough&lt;br /&gt;
# Once warp is over select your target destination and warp there&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Note&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;: Be extra careful with kickout stations (see https://jambeeno.com/sta). Once you undock from such a station you may (and, probably, will) not be able to dock again. So you’ll have only 1 chance to warp to the bookmark if the station is camped. It is recommended to avoid such stations if possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Note&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;: Once a ship undocks there is a short (about 5 seconds) session changing timer. It is impossible to dock again during this timer. So you may need to send multiple docking requests in case the first one doesn’t work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Note&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;: It is not recommended to use instaundock bookmarks while flying slow ships like freighters. It takes a lot of time for such ships to align to the target location. Even if a freighter successfully warps to the bookmark, campers still may be able to scan it down using combat probes faster then it’ll be able to align to the target destination. It may be a better tactic to undock and align to the target destination while remaining in the docking range of the station in this case. This way it should be possible to dock back if other people start performing offensive actions towards your ship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Note&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;: Never share your instaundock bookmarks with other pilots and always change bookmarks which could be compromised. Especially if you are using them frequently. Every shared bookmark should be considered compromised by default.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Creation==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are 2 types of space stations in EVE: stations with horizontal undock and stations with vertical undock. A procedure is different based on station type.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Stations with horizontal undocking===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Station with multiple undocks.png|thumb|A station with multiple horizontal undocking areas]]&lt;br /&gt;
Most stations have horizontal undocking mechanics. There are 2 types of them:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Stations with undocking area aligned with directions on the tactical overlay&lt;br /&gt;
* Stations rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise in regards to the tactical overview&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a station with horizontal undocking is aligned with the tactical overview:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Undock&lt;br /&gt;
# Stop your ship (using the Q-click piloting mode may be more effective)&lt;br /&gt;
# Visually identify the center of the undocking area of the station&lt;br /&gt;
# Position your ship at the center of the undocking area using manual piloting&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on the tactical overview&lt;br /&gt;
# Rotate the camera to look vertically down at the top of your ship&lt;br /&gt;
# Zoom out&lt;br /&gt;
# Use the Q-click piloting mode to order the ship to fly straight along undocking lights. This direction has to be the same as one of 90 degree lines on the tactical overview. Use these lines precisely to pick the correct direction. Range doesn’t matter much, 50 - 100 km should be more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;
# The ship will start aligning and moving towards the target point.&lt;br /&gt;
# Issue a stopping command to your ship once it fully aligns and gains some speed.&lt;br /&gt;
# The ship will lose its destination point and start decelerating, but its orientation in space and movement vector will remain the same.&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on max speed.&lt;br /&gt;
# Your ship will continue flying in the same direction as before, but there won’t be a final destination point anymore&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on your MWD or AB and wait until your ship flies far enough from the station.&lt;br /&gt;
# Create a bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;gallery mode=&amp;quot;packed&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;lt;/gallery&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a station with horizontal undocking is not aligned with the tactical overview the overall algorithm remains the same except the 8 step. It won’t be possible to use tactical overview directions to establish a precise direction for the ship in this case. So do this instead:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Take any resizable UI window&lt;br /&gt;
# Place this window near any line of undocking lights&lt;br /&gt;
# Use the top edge of the window as a guide and rotate the camera until undocking lights will be horizontal as well&lt;br /&gt;
# Place the top left corner of the window at your ship&lt;br /&gt;
# Use the top edge of the window as a guide and use the Q-click piloting mode to order the ship to fly straight along this edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Stations with vertical undocking===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Sentry gun under vertical station.png|thumb|A sentry gun under a station with vertical undocking mechanics]]&lt;br /&gt;
Some stations have vertical undocking mechanics. There are two types of them:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Undocking from amarrian stations ships fly downwards&lt;br /&gt;
# Undocking from The Fulcrum in Zarzakh ships fly upwards&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is impossible to create bookmarks in Zarzakh and it doesn’t really make sense to create instaundock bookmarks there considering the system-wide effect in this system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to create an instaundock bookmark for stations with downwards undocking mechanics:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Undock&lt;br /&gt;
# Stop your ship&lt;br /&gt;
# Make sure sentry guns are visible in your overview&lt;br /&gt;
# Check if there is a sentry gun right under the undocking area of the station&lt;br /&gt;
# Position your ship in the center of the undocking area&lt;br /&gt;
## If a sentry gun is not present, position the ship right under the station&lt;br /&gt;
## If a sentry gun is present, position the ship right under this sentry gun to avoid bumping into it&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on the tactical overlay (important: &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;do not&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; use first person view!)&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on the minimal speed possible by clicking the bottom left corner of the speed selector in the HUD&lt;br /&gt;
# Use the Pitch Down shortcut to manually rotate the ship downwards. Keep rotating until it doesn’t rotate anymore and flies straight down.&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on max speed&lt;br /&gt;
# Turn on your propulsion modules and wait&lt;br /&gt;
# Create a bookmark once you are far enough from the station&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
===Multiple bookmarks===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since it is impossible to have only 1 instaundock bookmark that works all the time you may want to create multiple bookmarks to cover more undocking angles. There may be multiple ways to do it based on the amount of calculations and flying you’re willing to do and the importance of these undocking bookmarks working all the time. Following are some options to place multiple instaundock bookmarks.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The layout with 9 bookmarks is the easiest to set up: horizontal and vertical bookmarks have to be created with 10° indent from the the central bookmark, and diagonal ones have to be created with 10° indent from the vertical ones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Fittings==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall any fit can be used to create instaundock bookmarks. However, it is recommended to use faster ships like frigates with propulsion modules because it usually involves flying out of the station’s grid which takes quite a lot of time. It is important to keep a fit cap stable since inability to use propulsion modules for some time to regenerate capacitor charge significantly slows down a ship and requires the pilot to turn modules on and off manually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following fit can get alpha pilots up to 7100 m/s of velocity with MWD turned on.&lt;br /&gt;

Note that for camped stations it may be better to use cloaked Covert Ops ships. Even though they are much slower, they have an ability to move relatively fast while being cloaked which may be essential to get past the camp.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;==Problem==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Landing outside a docking area.png|thumb|right|alt=This ship warped to 0 km warp-in point of a station, but landed 1923 meters from it. So it has to slowboat there in order to dock.|Landing outside a docking area]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a pilot selects a space station and issues a docking command their ship warps toward that station, lands at the warp-in point of that station and sends a docking request. However, due to EVE’s warping mechanics it is possible that it’ll exit the warp tunnel within 2500 meters range from the desired location. In this case it’ll have to fly to the docking area of the station in order for the docking procedure to kick in, which may take a significant amount of time (especially for bigger and slower ships). It opens a perfect opportunity for setting an ambush because the default warp-in points of all stations are the same for all players.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Solution==&lt;br /&gt;
Creation of instadock bookmarks allows pilots to use them instead of the default warp-in point of a station in order to guarantee that their ships always land within its docking area and can dock immediately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Mechanics==&lt;br /&gt;
In general, a docking area can be thought of as a giant invisible sphere wrapping a station. Depending on the station type the size of this area may vary a lot (see https://jambeeno.com/sta). Usually its edge is roughly indicated by a circle of flashing lights around the station (although it may not be always true). Another way to tell whether a ship is inside of the docking area or not is to look at the distance to the station - it has to be less than (roughly) 350 meters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Location of a ship doesn’t matter that much as long as it is inside the docking area. Therefore any bookmark inside this sphere can be used for docking. However, be sure to leave at least 2500 meters to the edge to compensate for a potential warp-in deviation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Usage==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are 2 ways to use instadock bookmarks. One of them involves autopilot, the other one requires pilots to dock manually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to use instadock bookmarks with &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;autopilot&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Select a space station and set it as a destination&lt;br /&gt;
# Select the instadock bookmark for this station&lt;br /&gt;
# Warp to 0 km to this bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
# Enable autopilot once the ship enters warping tunnel&lt;br /&gt;
# Autopilot will issue a docking command on the next server tick after the ship finishes its warp jump&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It takes some time for autopilot to kick in. Therefore it has to be enabled closer to the earlier stages of the jump in order for this trick to work! Turning it on right before the warp ends may not work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This method is pretty convenient because it doesn’t require any manual intervention from the pilot once everything is set up. But there is always a chance to get distracted and forget to turn on autopilot. So it is highly recommended to be ready to fallback to the manual method in case this one doesn’t work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to use instadock bookmarks &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;manually&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Select a space station and set it as a destination&lt;br /&gt;
# Select the instadock bookmark for this station&lt;br /&gt;
# Warp to 0 km to this bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
# Issue the docking command manually&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon exiting a warp tunnel your ship is invulnerable for a short period of time (there is no visual indication). So you should be able to dock before other pilots will be able to damage it. However, it may be better to send multiple docking requests so that your ship doesn’t float in space for too long in case something goes wrong. Some pilots even recommend clicking the Dock button repeatedly as fast as possible until the docking procedure kicks in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Creation==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are multiple types of instadock bookmarks and therefore multiple ways to create them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;gallery mode=&amp;quot;packed&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Docking area.png|Approximate docking area&lt;br /&gt;
Instadock on undock.png|Instadock in the undocking area&lt;br /&gt;

Instadock far from dock and undock.png|Instadock far from the docking and undocking areas&lt;br /&gt;
Instadock inside station.png|Instadock inside the station model&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/gallery&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The quickest way is to drop a bookmark right after your ship undocks from the target station. Usually it’ll end up in the docking area. However, it doesn’t work with kickout stations due to their docks being too close to the edge. Yet another issue of this method is that such bookmarks reside in the undocking area of a station which may be camped making it more dangerous to use them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to create an instadock bookmark &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;on undock&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Undock from the target station&lt;br /&gt;
# Wait until the black screen is over and you see space&lt;br /&gt;
# Use a shortcut to open the bookmark creation window (Ctrl + B)&lt;br /&gt;
# Use a shortcut to confirm a new bookmark creation (Enter)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The quicker you use these two shortcuts the closer the bookmark will be to the station.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another approach would be to &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;pick a random spot&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; inside the docking area of a station and drop a bookmark there. This way you are the only person who knows the location of this bookmark. It may require some manual piloting (use double clicking in space or Q-click piloting mode). Placing it far enough from the station’s docking and undocking areas may potentially make it harder for campers to attack you. Placing it closer to the station model reduces the risk of your ship exiting warp outside the docking area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet another approach is to create a bookmark &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;inside of the target station model&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;. Depending on the station type and the exact location of the bookmark your ship may gain quite a lot of speed upon arriving due to the game trying to fix the collision by pushing it outside. Sometimes it is possible to get a ship to constantly bounce inside a station model. Such high speed maneuvers may potentially decrease the amount of damage your ship is about to take in case docking doesn’t work the way it should. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to create a bookmark inside a station model:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
# Position your ship on one side of the station. It should be pretty close to the wall, but just far enough to allow your ship to accelerate and warp to another point on the other side of the station.&lt;br /&gt;
# Create a bookmark.&lt;br /&gt;
# Fly to the opposite side of the station.&lt;br /&gt;
# Fly at least 150-170 km from the first bookmark.&lt;br /&gt;
# Ensure that the station is between your ship and the first bookmark.&lt;br /&gt;
# Create another bookmark.&lt;br /&gt;
# Start jumping between these 2 bookmarks and try to drop an instadock bookmark when a ship flies through the station.&lt;br /&gt;
# Once you manage to drop a bookmark inside the station model - you are done. Feel free to delete those other 2 bookmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that if you end up inside a station model, docking is your only option - it is impossible to fly or warp anywhere else. It may also be dangerous to use such kind of bookmarks with big and heavy ships because they may get kicked out well beyond the docking area which may be a big problem in case you don’t dock fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Fittings==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any fit will do. However smaller ships like shuttles, frigates and corvettes may be faster and easier to maneuver in case you want to create a bookmark anywhere but the undocking area of the station.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Visit a once-imposing Gallente station, now scorched and silent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
In the eerie aftermath of Thera&amp;#039;s enigmatic calamity, a once-grand Gallente station stands scarred and silent, its mysteries deepening amidst the remnants of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Locations ===&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In the whispering void of Thera, a once-majestic station stands as a spectral relic, its fate veiled in an enigmatic shroud. Scarred and scorched, this Gallente-designed structure near Thera VII reveals a profound destruction. Clouds of plasma, gas, and dust cloak the station, its interior gutted by fire and explosions, leaving behind an empty husk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Expedition 5.png|500px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adjacent to the devastation, an untouched satellite, seemingly unscathed amid chaos, adds a layer of mystery. Once a radiation monitoring device, it assumed the role of an emergency communications relay. Yet, precise energy weapon strikes silenced its processing cores, leaving questions hanging in the cosmic void.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Expedition 4.png|500px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The wreckage paints a silent tableau—delicate structures survive where others crumble. Was this relay erected post-calamity, necessitating emergency communications from unknown sources?

::Karin Midular&amp;#039;s origins trace back to enslaved parents within the Amarr Empire, but as a baby, she was smuggled out and embraced by the Sebiestor Tribe that claimed her. Raised amidst the vast steppes of Mikramurka, in the Sebiestor heartland of Mithuris, Karin&amp;#039;s true identity unfolded upon reaching maturity. Beyond being a liberated orphan, her destiny took shape, weaving a unique narrative within the intricate tapestry of Matar&amp;#039;s history.&lt;br /&gt;

== What Is The Hub Scan Tool ==&lt;br /&gt;
Scanning Thera and Turnur as part of the [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;EvE-Scout Mapping Division&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;]] is a precise activity – that Signaleers sometimes have to do while under duress. The Hub Scan Tool is a web-based program that helps to simplify and speed up the process of scanning and recording Thera and Turnur signatures, while reducing typing errors. The tool makes it quick to see what signatures and bookmarks are expired or new, then makes updating them easier and more consistent. Ultimately, it helps new pilots learn to scan well and seasoned ones to do it faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hub Scan Tool is available here: https://scan.eve-scout.com/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Thera and Turnur Scanning Instructions ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Preparation ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Be in Thera or Turnur, undocked, and preferably cloaked at a safe in the scanning ship of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;
* Join the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;EvE-Scout.TheraMap&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; chat channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* Online the shared in-game bookmark folders:&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Signal Cartel \\ Thera&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;: this is our private folder. Put your bookmarks here!&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;EVE-Scout \\ Thera&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;: this is our public folder. Only Bookmark Managers have write permission.&lt;br /&gt;
** Links are given in the Alliance and Intel Channel chat MOTDs.&lt;br /&gt;
* Open the [https://scan.eve-scout.com/ Hub Scan Tool] and log in your pilot.&lt;br /&gt;
* Check the Hub Selector is set correctly:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Slide.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Assess the Status of the Current Thera or Turnur Map Using the Hub Scan Tool ===&lt;br /&gt;
Import the current lists of Thera/Turnur signatures from your Probe Scanner window into the Hub Scan Tool. See the instructions in the tool for more information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Import Signatures Tab ====&lt;br /&gt;
* Copy all of the Cosmic Signatures from your Probe Scanner window (you need to filter out all anomalies in your Probe Scanner window first) and paste them here (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V), then click the Update button to start mapping. If a new signature appears in your Probe Scanner later, copy and paste just that one into the import tab then Update to add it.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Import.png|600px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Scan Signatures Tab ====&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;quot;Scan Signatures&amp;quot; tab in the Hub Scan Tool will populate a table that cross-references with Probe Scanner data:&lt;br /&gt;
** Expired signatures are highlighted in orange,&lt;br /&gt;
** New signatures are highlighted in blue:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Blue.png|600px]][[File:Orange.png|600px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Clear the Expired Signatures ===&lt;br /&gt;
While it may seem counterintuitive at first, clearing expired signatures (highlighted in orange) should be prioritized over mapping new signatures.  This is because capsuleers will plan their routes based on potentially dated information and non-existent wormhole connections.  So clear those expired sigs!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Tip: There is a &amp;#039;Sort by: working order&amp;#039; option under the signatures list. If you select this, the signatures will sort into working order.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:HST Sort order options.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Confirm the Signature is Expired In-game ====&lt;br /&gt;
* Open the in-game Probe Scanner window and confirm that the expired signature ID is not listed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Delete the Expired Signature from Hub Scan Tool ====&lt;br /&gt;
* By selecting trash icon:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:trash.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* The new tool will update almost instantly for all users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Map the New Signatures ===&lt;br /&gt;
New signatures need to be scanned down, mapped, and then added to Hub Scan Tool. Using the Tool to help manage your workflow, you will work from left to right for each New Signature highlighted in blue on the &amp;quot;Scan Signatures&amp;quot; table.&lt;br /&gt;
* By clicking on the pen icon you automatically claim the signature (if another mapper will try to click on the sig you&amp;#039;re working on, an alert will pop up on their Tool denoting the sig has been claimed by your pilot).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Scan Down the Cosmic Signature ====&lt;br /&gt;
* Scan down the signature and assuming it&amp;#039;s a wormhole, you&amp;#039;re in business! &lt;br /&gt;
** If it&amp;#039;s a combat, data, relic or gas site enter its type in the Tool, save it, and move on to the next signature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;NOTE:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Teaching proper scanning techniques is beyond the scope of this guide. To learn more about scanning down Cosmic Signatures please see our Explorer&amp;#039;s Handbook [[Scanning]] page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Map the Signature ====&lt;br /&gt;
You will use the Hub Scan Tool to expedite your workflow moving from left to right along the row.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Enter the Outgoing Thera/Turnur-side Wormhole Type =====&lt;br /&gt;
* Warp to the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
** Once you are on grid with the wormhole, look for it&amp;#039;s [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_attributes type] on your in-game Overview.  If it&amp;#039;s not &amp;#039;K162&amp;#039;, enter it into the Type column of the Hub Scan Tool. For K162 you may just tab to the next field as this will be auto-populated.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:WH out.png|600px]][[File:WH out type.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
** Also, right click on the wormhole and select the &amp;quot;Show Info&amp;quot; option to discover if the wormhole&amp;#039;s lifetime is end-of-life (the info will show “reaching the end of its natural lifetime”).  Fill the dedicated tick in Hub Scan Tool if the WH is EOL (end of life).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Enter the Incoming Wormhole Type and Destination System =====&lt;br /&gt;
* Jump through the wormhole (assuming it&amp;#039;s safe).&lt;br /&gt;
* Enter the incoming wormhole&amp;#039;s type (if it&amp;#039;s k162, it will be auto-populated).&lt;br /&gt;
* Confirm the far system&amp;#039;s name into the Hub Scan Tool (it will auto-detect via the ESI):&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Farinfomod2.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Enter the Incoming Wormhole Signature =====&lt;br /&gt;
* Enter the incoming wormhole&amp;#039;s signature in the Far System&amp;#039;s Signature ID into the Hub Scan Tool.&lt;br /&gt;
** If there are multiple Cosmic Signatures in the far system, you will have to scan down which one you came in through.&lt;br /&gt;
** Highlight the signature in the Probe Scanner window, copy it (Ctrl-C), and then paste it (Ctrl-V) into the &amp;quot;Far System&amp;#039;s Signature ID&amp;quot; field in the Hub Scan Tool.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Insig.png|400px]][[File:Insig2.png|400px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* You&amp;#039;ve just mapped your first signature!  Now, let&amp;#039;s create some bookmarks to help share it with all of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Create the Far System &amp;quot;In Bookmark&amp;quot; ====&lt;br /&gt;
Once all the fields in the Hub Scan Tool are filled in for the New Signature, &amp;quot;In bookmark&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Out bookmark&amp;quot; labels will be generated by the tool.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:InBM.png|800px]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:OutBM.png|800px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Click the &amp;quot;In bookmark&amp;quot; label to copy it to your clipboard.&lt;br /&gt;
* Right-click on the wormhole from your in-game Overview to save its exact location (&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;this is important!&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;).&lt;br /&gt;
** Select &amp;#039;Save Location...&amp;#039;:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Savein.png|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* A &amp;quot;New Location&amp;quot; window for your in-game bookmark will pop up:&lt;br /&gt;
** Paste the &amp;quot;In Bookmark&amp;quot; into the Label field (Ctrl-V).&lt;br /&gt;
** Make sure the folder is set to: &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Signal Cartel \\ Thera&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;.&lt;br /&gt;
** Set the Expire time to &amp;quot;Never&amp;quot; (2 days is also okay).&lt;br /&gt;
** Click the &amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Create the Thera/Turnur-side &amp;quot;Out Bookmark&amp;quot; ==== &lt;br /&gt;
* Jump back through the wormhole to Thera or Turnur.&lt;br /&gt;
* In the Hub Scan Tool, click the &amp;quot;Out bookmark&amp;quot; label to copy it to your clipboard.&lt;br /&gt;
* Repeat the exact same steps as above to bookmark the Thera/Turnur-side of the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
** Remember to right-click on the wormhole from your in-game Overview to save its exact location (&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;this is important!&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;).&lt;br /&gt;
* It should look like this:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;[[File:Saveout.png|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Submit the New Signature in the Hub Scan Tool ====&lt;br /&gt;
* Submit the new signature to HST by clicking the tick on the rightmost column of the &amp;quot;Scan Signatures&amp;quot; table in the Hub Scan Tool.&lt;br /&gt;
* This will automatically update Hub Scan Tool data into our [https://www.eve-scout.com/ EvE-Scout Wormhole Connections].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Double-Check Yourself and Then Admire Your Work ===&lt;br /&gt;
* After submitting your signatures, always double-check yourself:&lt;br /&gt;
** Check your bookmarks using the Hub Scan Tool&lt;br /&gt;
** Check [https://www.eve-scout.com/ EvE-Scout Wormhole Connections] to make sure your sigs were properly pushed to the website. Note: There may be a delay of up to 10 minutes before the sig shows on the website.&lt;br /&gt;
* If everything is ok, please take a moment to bask in the glow of a job well done.  Congrats!  Now get on with the next sig because Thera and Turnur are ever-changing and mysterious places that you are now a part of!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Caution is advised.|tip=Set each system in the TripTik as a waypoint, then choose Autopilot options to establish a route for your expedition.}}       __NOTOC__&lt;br /&gt;

Visit a sight in DUO-51, where law enforcement uses a criminal&amp;#039;s opulent residence as a base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
At times, law enforcement strategically employs the opulent residence of a high-profile criminal as their operational base to track down a specific target. Presently, such tactics unfold in DUO-51. Martokar Alash, aligned with the Angel Cartel, wielded substantial wealth and influence, enabling him to exert control over an entire Minmatar Industry Station. However, such a formidable presence necessitates removal, given the requisite political connections with the Thukker Tribe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Supervising the operation are two Nidhoggur-class Carriers and three Tempest-class Battleships. The aftermath paints a vivid picture of destruction. A once lively station, now stripped of its defenses and lying dormant, bows sadly amidst a field of debris, frozen corpses, and the remnants of ghost ships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Republic&amp;#039;s determination to neutralize this warlord is evident, with its agents actively recruiting on-site for the impending mission.&lt;br /&gt;

Visit a Grand symbol of faith and influence in the Amarr Empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
The sacred duty bestowed upon the Order of St. Tetrimon by the Council of Apostles was the solemn preservation of the pristine Amarr Scriptures, coupled with the solemn task of expunging any apocryphal or non-canonical texts. This sacred charge encompassed the majority of Zaragram II&amp;#039;s decrees, deemed divergent from the sanctified canon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Order of St. Tetrimon Fortress Monastery, situated in Thebeka&amp;#039;s outskirts, stands as a symbol of faith and influence in the Amarr Empire. Adorned with towering cathedrals and gleaming spires. Despite historical tensions and Imperial interference, the Order&amp;#039;s revival aligns with changes in the Amarr Empire. Serving House Ardishapur, the fortress in Thebeka acts as a religious center and strategic ally, maintaining distance from political complexities. The main structure, cathedral-like, is surrounded by smaller honor guard structures. The Order&amp;#039;s history, from exile to resurgence, weaves into New Eden&amp;#039;s cosmic tapestry, reflecting enduring religious fervor and martial strength.&lt;br /&gt;

Visit many Historical sights and Battlefields from the Minmatar Rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
For centuries, the Amarr Empire ruled over the enslaved Minmatar peoples after their brutal conquest of the Minmatar Empire. Faced with the Amarr&amp;#039;s brutal response to any slave uprisings, up to and including the outright genocide of the Starkmanir tribe, Minmatar resistance cells developed a strategy of carefully preparing for an organized rebellion in the shadows to leave the Amarr complacent and unaware of the resistance&amp;#039;s true strength. They would wait until the right moment for a coordinated uprising.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That moment came in BYC20 when the Amarr sent a massive fleet of warships to attack the Jove in the system of Vak’Atioth. The Jove crushed the Amarr fleet, and the Minmatar resistance began their Great Rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Amarr, already demoralized from their defeat by the Jovians, were caught in disarray. The Minmatar made significant gains early on, driving the Amarr out of numerous systems including Pator, home of the Matari, as well as decimating a large portion of the Empire&amp;#039;s capital ship forces in the Battle of the Golgothan Fields and Siege of Lord Bastion. The Rebellion came to a head at the Battle of Fort Kavad, wherein the Minmatar won a costly but significant victory that drove the Amarr out of their last stronghold in Minmatar space. Amarr Emperor Heideran VII declared no further official military action be taken against the Minmatar on penalty of death and shored up the Ammatar Mandate, a puppet state ostensibly run by the collaborating Nefantar, as a buffer against further Minmatar offensives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Locations ===&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;[https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Molden_Heath/Ennur#sec Ennur]&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
::&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Golgothan Fields&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; - Reeling from their crushing defeat at the hands of the Jove, the Amarr sought to put down the Minmatar Rebellion as quickly as possible. The Minmatar rebels met the main Amarr fleet in Ennur with all the ships they could muster in a desperate stand to keep the Amarr from burning through the Minmatar homeworlds before their rebellion could truly take off. After hours of fighting, the Minmatar were forced to withdraw, though not before crippling the Amarr&amp;#039;s capital ship superiority and buying the rebellion time to consolidate its gains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::Today, the battlefield at the Golgothan Fields stands as a reminder of the Minmatar war of liberation, with the decrepit husks of ships from both sides left drifting in space. Until the later Battle of Iyen-Oursta during the Caldari-Gallente War, the Battle of the Golgothan Fields was the second-largest space battle in recorded history, only surpassed by Vak&amp;#039;Atioth.&lt;br /&gt;

::&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;TES Reclamation Wreck&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; - The Minmatar began consolidating their liberated territory after early successes such as the liberation of their homeworld and the Battle of the Golgothan Fields, putting the Amarr-aligned Nefantar tribe in the rebellion&amp;#039;s crosshairs. In response to the Nefantar tribe&amp;#039;s request for help, the Amarr dispatched a large capital ship, the TES Reclamation, along with a support fleet. However, the Reclamation was destroyed by a saboteur only a week after deployment in a cascade of sabotage inspired by the assassination of the Nefantar&amp;#039;s tribal leader. With the Reclamation destroyed, the Amarr were put squarely on the defensive for the remainder of the war.&lt;br /&gt;

::&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Lord Bastion&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; - Orbiting the Nefantar homeworld of Hjoramald XII, Lord Bastion was a fortress built by Lord Basad, the Amarr governor of the Ani constellation, during the Minmatar Rebellion. To construct the fortress, Basad used the brief respite granted to him by the arrival of the TES Reclamation and its supporting force. After the destruction of the Reclamation by sabotage, the Minmatar rebels turned their sights to Lord Bastion, which held out for two months while cut off from the rest of the Empire before finally falling to the Minmatar rebels. The Nefantar fled the Ani constellation and reorganized into the Ammatar Mandate, and the ruined carcass of Lord Bastion continues to hang in orbit above their ancestral home. Some Minmatar demand that the wreck be dismantled, while others see it as a testament to the Minmatar spirit.&lt;br /&gt;

::&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Battle of Fort Kavad Monument&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; - The site of the last major battle of the Minmatar Rebellion, Fort Kavad was strategically located at the last Amarrian redoubt in Minmatar space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::In BYC17, the Amarr, having lost many of their capital ships at the Battle of the Golgothan Fields, began massing their remaining forces at Fort Kavad in preparation for a counterattack into the liberated Minmatar territories. The Minmatar learned of the plan and launched a preemptive strike, crippling Fort Kavad&amp;#039;s defenses and the unready Amarr forces gathering there. However, the Minmatar themselves incurred steep losses due to many Amarr officers refusing to surrender and launching suicidal attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::After the disastrous battle, the Amarr effectively withdrew from Minmatar space under penalty of death from the Emperor himself, who instead solidified the Ammatar Mandate as a buffer against further Minmatar advances.&lt;br /&gt;

::&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Fort Kumar&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; - Transformed from a mining outpost into a military bulwark during the Rebellion, Fort Kumar was critical to repelling further Minmatar advances into the Ammatar Mandate and Amarr Empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
::Though it saw little use in the intervening decades, Fort Kumar has become a center of attention once again, with Amarr, Ammatar, and even Caldari forces massing at the Fort in preparation of renewed war with the Minmatar Republic.&lt;br /&gt;

This sculpture was built on the foundation of an older asteroid colony. While technological evidence suggests that the colony was constructed at some point during the Amarr occupation, some believe that it was a secret pirate base, with others believing that it was a rebel hideout or even a relic from the days of the Minmatar Empire.&lt;br /&gt;

The station honors the sacrifices of the Minmatar Rebellion, with museum sections dedicated to that war, to the various Minmatar tribes, to heroes of the Rebellion, and to the old Minmatar Empire.&lt;br /&gt;

A site shrouded in mystery, harboring whispers and speculations regarding a potential occurrence of biological warfare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
This site celebrates the determination of Gallente citizens to reclaim one of their prized planets. The planet was hit by a devastating plague that caused the extinction of a crucial genus of insects, which led to the collapse of the entire global ecosystem. Despite the failure of cloning or replacing these insects, the Gallente citizens didn&amp;#039;t give up and constructed an installation on the planet. The installation boasts of Gallente architecture and consists of an HQ, a logistic station, and a science facility. Additionally, there are custom offices and landing pads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the same system, you can find an abandoned mining colony. There is a massive drill that lies dormant, and a forsaken ghost ship oversees the area.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Recommended starter fits for the abyss, in conjunction with the main &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;[[Abyssal_Deadspace |Abyssal Deadspace]]&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; page and &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;[[Abyssal_Enemies | Abyssal Enemies]]&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Introduction =&lt;br /&gt;
Each tier is a considerable step up from the previous one in terms of difficulty and rewards. For people completely new to the abyss, it&amp;#039;s recommended to start at T0 to get a feel for the mechanics. For most Gila and Heavy Assault Cruiser fits, it&amp;#039;s a good idea to start no lower than T3, as you&amp;#039;ll simply overpower most spawns in lower tiers with those ships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Credit goes to Caldari Joans for testing and compiling many of the starter fits listed here, or at least providing a basis for them. His [https://caldarijoans.streamlit.app/Starter_Abyssal_Fits Streamlit site] is a great repository of fitting advice and piloting tips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Why does the module layout look so weird? =&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#039;s for heat management. Generally, you want to have your most-heated modules as far away from each other as possible to reduce heat damage to important stuff, with less important or passive modules serving as buffer. Note that the ingame fitting tool tends to break module spacing on imported fits, so be careful and make sure your modules are spaced correctly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Tier 0 =&lt;br /&gt;
To do T0 safely, pilots should aim for a minimum of &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;90 DPS&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; (damage per second) in their weather&amp;#039;s preferred damage type. Going lower can work, but risks failing the 20 minute site timer with several long spawns. Nearly anything that does enough damage and has something vaguely resembling a tank can handle T0 just fine, but here are 2 reliable frigate fits that are proven to work in this tier. They&amp;#039;re cheap, require next to no skill training, and are tried and tested to work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Electrical Beam Starter Punisher ==&lt;br /&gt;
This is a day 0 alpha-friendly Punisher fit for &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;T0 electrical&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; filaments. Once your skills allow you to clear 150 DPS, you can start using this fit in T1, or upgrade to the T1 fit in that tier&amp;#039;s section. If you have extra CPU, you can change the turrets to Small Focused Anode Particle Stream I to save some ISK. Once your skills allow, you can upgrade the turrets and low slot modules to their Tech II variants. This fit can do T0 firestorms as well, but may face timer and capacitor issues in T1 fires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Punisher is a very strong (and cheap!) ship even with low skills, and is arguably the best ship for new players to learn the abyss with. The Imperial Navy Slicer is similar to the Punisher and a great ship, but just doesn&amp;#039;t pull ahead in the abyss due to its substantially higher cost and not even dealing more damage than the Punisher&amp;#039;s 4 hardpoints until Amarr Frigate V... at which point you may as well just fly a Retribution.&lt;br /&gt;

== Dark Rocket Starter Kestrel ==&lt;br /&gt;
This is a day 0 alpha-friendly Kestrel fit for &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;T0 dark&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; filaments. Unlike the Punisher fit, this is shield-tanked and uses rockets for more missile-inclined pilots. This fit also adds an extra layer of difficulty due to the weather not having a resist penalty: damage selection. That&amp;#039;s right! You&amp;#039;ll have to pick and choose which damage type to use against each enemy. The lack of a weather resist penalty also makes it very important to play aggressively. If you can&amp;#039;t do at least 90 DPS, don&amp;#039;t take this into T0. If you can&amp;#039;t do at least 150, don&amp;#039;t take this into T1. Upgrade modules to their Tech II variants as skills allow. Your most difficult spawn in this fit in T0 will likely be the &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Skybreaker&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, an Edencom frigate with a strong active shield tank. Use thermal damage against it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you enjoy the Kestrel, the next step up will be a Caldari Navy Hookbill for T1 darks. Unlike the Slicer, the Hookbill offers quite a few advantages for abyss running over its Tech I version.&lt;br /&gt;

= Tier 1 =&lt;br /&gt;
To clear T1 solo, you&amp;#039;ll want at least &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;150 DPS&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; with your weather&amp;#039;s preferred damage type. You don&amp;#039;t need much tank here; one Tech II shield or armor repper on a frigate is fine. Your tank comes from speed, small signature, and damage. Repair modules aren&amp;#039;t for permatanking enemy spawns; they&amp;#039;re for buying time until you can kill them and get incoming damage to 0 that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might notice that there are no recommended Tech I Gallente or Minmatar frigate fits here. That&amp;#039;s because they just don&amp;#039;t have the damage or projection to consistently handle T1, and even fall behind in T0. Most any ship will be able to get through T0, but it makes sense to go for a ship or at least a kind of ship that can handle T1 as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Electrical Beam Punisher ==&lt;br /&gt;
This one&amp;#039;s similar to the T0 version, but since you&amp;#039;ll probably have a bit of experience at this point, it trades tank for more damage. Upgrade to Tech II beams and heat sinks when you have the skills. A major advantage of this fit over the Hookbill below is that it can easily outrange dangerous spawns like the Kikimora and Tessera with Radio/Aurora crystals.&lt;br /&gt;

== Dark Rocket Hookbill ==&lt;br /&gt;
A more expensive step up from the T0 Kestrel fit, this improves on the Kestrel with more damage and tank. Unlike with the Punisher, it&amp;#039;s important that you can use Tech II weapons here, since dark weather lacks a resistance penalty. Not using Tech II launchers is viable, but risks timing out.&lt;br /&gt;

= T1 Blitz Frigate Fits =&lt;br /&gt;
All 4 previously listed fits are starter fits, intended to provide a solid learning experience for new pilots. These are more advanced (and expensive) takes on the same themes, intended for blitzing T1 filaments in mere minutes to extract as much ISK as possible. There are 2 takes on each &amp;quot;style&amp;quot; of fit, one for alpha and one for omega pilots. Earning 70 million ISK an hour is very doable with these fits, even as an alpha. That&amp;#039;s roughly what you&amp;#039;d get on average doing hisec DED sites in an optimized fit. Not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the point where alpha pilots will hit a wall. When it comes to abyss running as a solo alpha, your &amp;quot;endgame&amp;quot; options are to blitz t1 filaments in one of the below fits, run T2 filaments in a cruiser for less profit, or spend copious amounts of ISK on a T3-capable alpha-friendly Gila fit, still won&amp;#039;t outperform T1 frigate blitzing and is far harder to stomach losing. You won&amp;#039;t really pull ahead of T1 frigate blitzing ISK-wise until T4 cruisers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At over 100 million ISK for the full fits, the Succubus and Worm are both more expensive and less effective at blitzing T1 filaments than the Omega alternatives, and will not handle T2. They&amp;#039;re only recommended for Alpha pilots with spare ISK to spend, or Omega pilots looking for something different to try.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Electrical Alpha Succubus ==&lt;br /&gt;
An alpha-friendly souped-up version of the T1 starter Punisher that deals more damage and is more survivable, albeit with higher cost and a shield tank instead of armor. The CPU&amp;#039;s also tight, so downgrade a heat sink to compact if needed.&lt;br /&gt;

== Exotic Alpha Worm ==&lt;br /&gt;
An Alpha-friendly souped-up version of the T1 starter Hookbill fit, albeit for exotic weather and with an emphasis on drones along with missiles. You don&amp;#039;t need to worry about damage selection anymore due to the weather resist penalty. Just be careful about losing your drones and getting defanged. Even with the Worm&amp;#039;s role bonus, they&amp;#039;re still flimsy light drones. This fit also uses light missiles instead of rockets, letting you control range more effectively. This fit can also run firestorms with good skills by switching the drones to Hobgoblins and missiles to Inferno. Just be aware that rooms will take longer to clear.&lt;br /&gt;

== Electrical Pulse Retribution ==&lt;br /&gt;
An Assault Frigate fit for omegas. This fit relies on the absurd DPS of a properly skilled pulse retribution to faceroll T1 rooms. It&amp;#039;s also the first fit here to use a microwarpdrive instead of an afterburner. Assault Frigates get a reduction to the MWD signature penalty, and a MWD lets you move around rooms much faster than an AB. However, MWDs do add an additional element to learn, and are not recommended for inexperienced players. If less experienced but still skilled into Assault Frigates, use the beam Retribution fit beneath this one.&lt;br /&gt;

== Electrical Beam Retribution ==&lt;br /&gt;
A more pilot-friendly version of the above fit that uses beams instead of pulses, sacrificing raw damage for better range control. This fit can also do T2 electrical filaments solo, but that takes far longer and is unlikely to improve your ISK/hr. Running T2 in a solo frigate is only recommended for experienced players for the challenge. This fit also uses an afterburner for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;

== Exotic Rocket Hawk ==&lt;br /&gt;
The omega version of the alpha exotic Worm and starter Hookbill, this fit combines rockets with the exotic resist penalty to clear T1 rooms quickly. Just be aware that rockets don&amp;#039;t have much range and you need to fly smart around Tesseras. This fit also has a MWD instead of an AB. The blaster&amp;#039;s just for a bit of extra DPS; you don&amp;#039;t really need it. An overview of the fit by the creator&amp;#039;s available [https://abysstracker.com/fit/9659 here].&lt;br /&gt;

== Exotic LML Hawk ==&lt;br /&gt;
This friendlier version of the above fit uses light missiles instead of rockets, and an AB instead of a MWD. Much like the beam Retribution, this fit sacrifices raw damage for better range control. It&amp;#039;s also T2 exotic-capable, but again, that&amp;#039;s unlikely to be an ISK/hr bump over blitzing T1. The creator of the basis of this fit has an overview [https://abysstracker.com/fit/2492 here].&lt;br /&gt;

= Tier 2 =&lt;br /&gt;
The next big step up in difficulty. It&amp;#039;s possible to run a solo Assault Frigate in this tier, but it&amp;#039;ll require additional pilot skill and time to clear rooms. Running solo T2 frigates is more for the challenge than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Electrical Omega Vexor ==&lt;br /&gt;
While T2 cruisers will earn less than T1 blitz frigates, T2&amp;#039;s still a good tier to learn the basics of flying cruisers in preparation for higher tiers. With that in mind, here&amp;#039;s a T2 Vexor fit for omegas. Upgrade the reps to Tech II when you can. The small beams aren&amp;#039;t necessary; any weapon system you can put on there for supplemental damage will help. All suggested fits on this page are Omega-only from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that while Alphas can probably use this Vexor with the right skills, T2 is enough of a step up from T1 that Alpha support skills are likely to be inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;

= Tier 3 =&lt;br /&gt;
This tier&amp;#039;s in a strange place. Solo frigates can&amp;#039;t run it, Tech I cruisers can&amp;#039;t run it, and navy cruisers will struggle. On the flip side, beefier ships like Gilas and HACs will simply overpower T3 spawns. This tier&amp;#039;s mainly used by players testing blingy fits in lighter conditions before going up to high tiers. As such, there&amp;#039;s no recommended starter fit here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Tier 4 =&lt;br /&gt;
Due to how forgiving they are to learn with, this section will only cover Gilas, with non-Gila options in the T5 and T6 sections. None of the T4 fits require implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== The Povertila ==&lt;br /&gt;
This is the first &amp;quot;big boy&amp;quot; fit so far. The Povertila&amp;#039;s an upgradable fit designed by Balsaq/Scott Dominus that can comfortably handle T4 exotics stock, and T5 exotics with a bit of bling. Blingier versions of this fit can technically do T6 exotic, but the fit just doesn&amp;#039;t scale well into T6 and a lot of rooms will be difficult. This fit&amp;#039;s main weakness is neut pressure, and bling doesn&amp;#039;t really help with that. Consult the fit on [https://abysstracker.com/fit/6580 Abyss Tracker] for more detailed piloting tips by the creator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only modification to the orginal fit is that this version uses a thermal shield rig instead of an EM one. The EM rig&amp;#039;s just on there because the original fit&amp;#039;s intended to do electrical filaments as well, but Gilas thrive in exotic filaments above all others. The thermal rig helps with difficult Triglavian rooms. The nos isn&amp;#039;t necessary and can be dropped if you&amp;#039;re tight on fitting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To upgrade the Povertila for T5, start by getting a faction shield boost amplifier and switching the DCU for a third DDA. Then start getting Mid-Grade Crystal implants. You don&amp;#039;t need to bling the hardener or shield boosters for T5. Just make sure to pre-roll Standard Blue Pill and overheat preemptively in difficult rooms. To use this fit in electrical, just switch the thermal rig for an EM one and change the drones to Infiltrators. To use it in gamma, just switch the drones to Valkyries, but be warned that timing out is a real risk.&lt;br /&gt;

== The Passive Fit ==&lt;br /&gt;
Designed by the creator of the Povertila, this fit relies on a passive/regen shield tank instead and is designed to run up to T4 gamma weather. The advantage of this fit over the Povertila is that you have fewer things to manage and mistakes won&amp;#039;t kill you as quickly. It also has the fitting space for a T2 drone link augmentor and afterburner. The downside is that you have fewer tools at your disposal when things go wrong (what can you overheat?) and might not register that you made a mistake before it&amp;#039;s already too late to fix it. Due to the gamma weather, this fit also uses lower-damage Minmatar drones, which present a timeout risk when combined with gamma&amp;#039;s 50% shield bonus. Upgrading the fit for higher tiers also entails purchasing expensive Nirvana implants, which quickly balloon the fit&amp;#039;s cost past active alternatives. On the bright side, passive fits are very difficult to gank and most of the fit&amp;#039;s value in higher tiers is in your instawarping pod. There&amp;#039;s a full writeup by the creator on the fit&amp;#039;s [https://abysstracker.com/fit/6597 Abyss Tracker] page.&lt;br /&gt;

= Tier 5 =&lt;br /&gt;
Since the Povertila above can run Tier 5 with the listed upgrades, this section will cover some non-Gila options for Tier 5. All of these fits can handle lower tiers as well. The thing to understand about T5 is that it&amp;#039;s mainly a &amp;quot;gear check&amp;quot;: any fit that can do T4 can probably do T5 with enough blue and green modules. Tier 6 is where things really thin out in terms of ship choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Standard boosters on these fits need to be pre-rolled, meaning that you consume a booster, check side effects, and reset the booster by jumping to a clone in the same station and back until you get a roll without side effects. None of the T5 fits require implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is one room unique to this tier (it doesn&amp;#039;t appear in Tier 6): the Shipyard.&lt;br /&gt;
== Exotic Cerberus ==&lt;br /&gt;
An alternative to the Gila for exotics, the Cerberus forgoes most drone damage in favor of missiles. This fit&amp;#039;s designed by Nomirre, and you can find it at this [https://abysstracker.com/fit/14313 Abyss Tracker] page. This fit can be made cheaper, but do so at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;

== Dark Muninn ==&lt;br /&gt;
This cheap baseline fit was designed by Caldari Joans to handle T5 darks, and he has a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbdgUAON6E video walkthrough and demonstration] on YouTube. Compared to the Cerberus above, this fit is certainly cheaper, but requires more piloting skill and gives less room for error. With a high-tier armor fit, it&amp;#039;s even more important to overheat preemptively, as reps land at the end of a cycle.&lt;br /&gt;

= Tier 6 =&lt;br /&gt;
You made it! All fits here have been extensively tested to work consistently. That&amp;#039;s why there are no Stormbringer fits here even though it&amp;#039;s a popular ship: 2 overmind rooms and 1 moderate-length room could cause you to lose to the timer through no fault of your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fits here use Packrat MTUs for tractoring in can wrecks more quickly. Only use a Magpie if you feel comfortable both in T6 and with not leaving MTUs behind. Magpies are expensive!&lt;br /&gt;
== On Implants ==&lt;br /&gt;
Tier 6 pretty much requires running at least mid-grade implants sets with additional hardwirings and drugs. Each fit&amp;#039;s section describes implant choices, but due to limited space in the fit simulations themselves, most of the implants won&amp;#039;t be shown there. Do &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;NOT&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; run these T6 fits without implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Exotic Gila ==&lt;br /&gt;
The first T6 fit here is a dual-battery Gila. Created by Arachnis and revised with input from Hyperion, this fit provides excellent cap stability and neut resists through two large batteries while avoiding having to use Thurifer batteries for fitting and ballooning the fit&amp;#039;s cost. The heavy launcher can pop caches in a single hit with Caldari Navy Scourge ammo. It&amp;#039;s vital to overheat hardeners liberally and preemptively, as they build heat slowly and provide the fit&amp;#039;s buffer and repping power. Stagger hardener cycles to get the most out of overheating. Use Navy drones for most targets, T2 drones for battleships, and Augmented drones for Ephialtes (they have low omni-resists). Downgrading the hardeners to C-types will make the fit cheaper. It&amp;#039;ll still be perfectly viable, just harder to fly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to spend additional ISK, purchase an Overmind &amp;#039;Goliath&amp;#039; Drone Tuner T25-10S implant to make your drones far more survivable. Then, mutate Navy Vespas until you get 2 with same or greater tracking and as much damage as you can get while keeping other stats reasonable (or just buy 2 good ones off contracts), and drop the T2 and Augmented drones for 2 more navy flights. The mutated drones will be your primary damage flight, with navy drones for Angel and Tessera rooms (which are deadly to drones). Upgrading the afterburner to a Corelum B-Type will also speed up clear times and reduce incoming damage. High-Grade Crystal implants aren&amp;#039;t necessary, but do make things more comfortable. Missile and capacitor hardwiring implants are also a good addition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Minimum Implants:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mid-Grade Crystals with drone, capacitor, and light missile hardwirings depending on budget.&lt;br /&gt;

== Gamma Ishtar ==&lt;br /&gt;
Based on fits such as [https://abysstracker.com/fit/3044 this one], this Ishtar can consistently clear T6 gamma for roughly the same price tag as the Gila fits above. It makes use of Geckos as its primary damage source to avoid the Gila&amp;#039;s issue of relying on lower-damage Minmatar drones in gamma weather. Despite its very high repping power, the fit has 2 weaknesses. Firstly, Ishtars are paper-thin. While the gamma weather bonus helps here, it doesn&amp;#039;t change the fact that you&amp;#039;re in a thin ship susceptible to high alpha damage. This makes preemptively overheating your hardener essential. Secondly, only having a single large battery and a cap-hungry XL booster makes this fit vulnerable to neut pressure, meaning that rooms with high-neuting spawns you can&amp;#039;t quickly clear, like some Vedmak spawns, can be trickly. The assault damage control helps here, but only somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For these reasons, the best area to invest additional ISK is in getting a good mutated cap battery. After that, you can get a Corelum B-Type afterburner and upgrade your Crystals to high-grade. With high-grade implants, you don&amp;#039;t technically need drugs (still recommended, though).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Use 2 Geckos with 2 Fleet Valkyries as your primary damage flight, with a Warrior in a separate flight flying around the room and popping caches. Use the Ishtar&amp;#039;s enormous drone bay to store spare drones for when your active ones get damaged. If you use mutated Fleet Valkyries, have 1 flight with the mutated drones and 1 flight without them (for spawns such as Tesseras and Angels).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Minimum Implants:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mid-Grade Crystals, optionally with an Overmind &amp;#039;Goliath&amp;#039; Drone Tuner T25-10S and capacitor hardwiring.&lt;br /&gt;

== Gamma Vagabonds ==&lt;br /&gt;
Much like the Ishtar, the Vagabond is a thin ship that relies on an oversized shield booster to provide enormous repping power. Unlike the Ishtar, the gamma Vagabond is a fast turret ship that specializes in ripping up targets from up close. There are two vetted takes on fitting this ship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first version uses 425mm autocannons and a Pith X-Type Large Shield Booster, with a Mid-Grade Crystal implant set. This particular fit&amp;#039;s a cheaper version of [https://torvalduruz.streamlit.app/Gamma_Vagabond Torvald Uruz&amp;#039;s T6 gamma Vagabond]. You can find a lot of playthroughs with his fit on his YouTube channel, such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5kw83pmoBk this one]. In exchange for the lower price tag, this fit does require rolling standard boosters. Upgrading the tank modules will let you go down to synth or not use drugs entirely. Another difference is that the below fit uses a Drone Link Augmentor instead of Tractor Beam to let your drones get to faraway cans more easily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Minimum Implants:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mid-Grade Crystals with capacitor and medium projectile hardwirings.&lt;br /&gt;

The second Vagabond fit is a 220mm Vulcan version based on [https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting/vagabond/617602ba-a2ab-4d4c-8707-08db12c77f3f this fit] by Gustav Mannfred. In exchange for worse projection and damage over time against large targets, this variant gets additional fitting space for an XL shield booster for more tank. It also tracks small targets better. Unfortunately, it does have an explosive resist hole, so be careful there. It&amp;#039;s also more vulnerable to neuting. This particular version&amp;#039;s cheaper than Gustav&amp;#039;s, and so uses a standard Blue Pill booster to compensate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Minimum Implants:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mid-Grade Crystals with capacitor and medium projectile hardwirings.&lt;br /&gt;

== Exotic Cerberus ==&lt;br /&gt;
An alternative to the exotic Gila, this fit is an upgraded (and more expensive!) version of the T5 Cerberus. Like the Ishtar, a major weakness is neuting due to the single battery. Consider getting a mutated battery, and heat the hardener early and often.&lt;br /&gt;

== Dark Ikitursa ==&lt;br /&gt;
The last and most unique fit in this section, this take on the Ikitursa was created by Caldari Joans. It makes use of the unique Triglavian weapon system in conjunction with smartbombs to clear dark weather, which forces rats into smartbomb range due to the significantly reduced turret range and therefore orbit distance. For a full overview of this fit with stripped-down variants for lower tiers, check out [https://caldarijoans.streamlit.app/Dark_Ikitursa CJ&amp;#039;s Streamlit page]. He also has a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB1XfSZ5SvI video overview] on his YouTube channel. Note that this setup is pricey on its own, and needs a mutation for PG to be within fitting constraints.&lt;br /&gt;

Visit a once-grand player-owned trading tower.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
The most prominent player-owned market structure in history, the Tranquility Trading Tower (TTT) was a Keepstar-class XL Citadel first deployed in Perimeter by TEST Alliance in YC120. The following year, the Imperium and Pandemic Horde gained joint management of the project in a partnering arrangement, and the Fraternity joined up 2 years later in YC123.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In YC125, the Imperium left the agreement after new XL structures were prohibited from anchoring in high-security space, citing both the anchoring change and disagreements over the handling of the partnership. The Imperium proceeded to destroy the structure. The TTT remains commemorated by this monument of its wreckage.&lt;br /&gt;

An abandoned Trash Waste yard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
One of the worst aspects of Humankind is its need to pollute. From their Cradle-Earth to the stars and, finally, to New Eden, they always find a way to lay their wastes around. In Eurgrana there is such a place. Partially sealed and damaged, lost silos wander in a green-toxic cloud that only attracts bad-taste pests: Angel Cartel.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever heard of a phenomenon called &amp;quot;Trace Cosmos&amp;quot;? It is a peculiar purple-haze-colored vaporous cloud that can be seen with the naked eye from the Gererique High Sec system. This field&amp;#039;s genesis is attributed to a cluster of minor black holes and atypical spatial rifts by scientists. The Duvolle Laboratories corporate research facility is located near this strange cloud. The Shadow Cartel Alliance&amp;#039;s Astrahus guards the system.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Detailed guide to all possible enemies in the abyss, in conjunction with the main &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;[[Abyssal_Deadspace | Abyssal Deadspace]]&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; page and the &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;[[Abyssal_Fits | Abyssal Fits]]&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; page.&lt;br /&gt;
= Angel Cartel (&amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot;) =&lt;br /&gt;
A relatively recent addition to the abyss, Angel rooms can be tricky due to the rats&amp;#039;, especially the Cynabals&amp;#039;, high speed, webs, and good damage combined with excellent projection and tracking.&lt;br /&gt;
== Enemy Profiles ==&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable sortable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Elite Lucifer Dramiel || Elite Frigate || DPS || Webs || High || Explosive, Kinetic || Explosive || Closes fast, will target and web drones, more damage than standard Dramiel&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Lucifer Echo || Frigate || DPS, EWAR || Scrams, Webs || Moderate || Explosive, Kinetic || Explosive || Very thin frigate that does a surprising amount of damage up close. Consider clearing one at the beginning of the room to quickly remove DPS and a web from the field&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Lucifer Ixion || Cruiser || EWAR || Target Paints, Missile Disrupts || Low || Thermal, Kinetic || Explosive || Thin painting cruiser that stays at range. Does little damage itself and other Angels have no problems applying their own damage anyway&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Lucifer Medusa || Frigate || EWAR || Sensor Damps || Low || Thermal, Kinetic || Explosive || Thin damping frigate, only annoying in large numbers due to reduced lock range&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Lucifer Swordspine || Frigate || EWAR || Target Paints || Low || Thermal, Kinetic || Explosive || Thin painting frigate. Can mostly ignore&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Dangers ==&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the Cynabals&amp;#039; good damage, webs, and great tracking and projection, Angel rooms are notoriously difficult for frigates. The Cynabal neuts also severely pressure many cruisers&amp;#039; capacitors, especially if only running a single battery. However, the danger of this room is concentrated in a handful of enemies, and once the Cynabals are off the field, it becomes pretty easy. Angel rooms can also be tricky for drone ships, since many enemies have webs and will switch to drones en masse. However, if they&amp;#039;re shooting your drones, at least they&amp;#039;re not shooting you for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
== Tips ==&lt;br /&gt;
Clear Cynabals first, followed by Elite Cynabals, unless there&amp;#039;s some other immediate threat. Lucifer Echos deal a lot of damage for how flimsy they are, so it can make sense to clear one first to reduce pressure on your tank before starting on the Cynabals. Lucifer Bursts do remote shield rep the other rats, but the reps aren&amp;#039;t all that strong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= CONCORD / EDENCOM (&amp;quot;Disparu&amp;quot;) =&lt;br /&gt;
Another relatively recent addition, this room contains enemies that exclusively do missile-style damage through actual missiles (CONCORD) and Vorton Projectors (EDENCOM). This means that transversal is irrelevant, but having a small signature and maintaining high speed is essential. The rats do a lot of alpha damage but fire slowly, so losing speed or entering a blue cloud at the wrong moment can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;
== Enemy Profiles ==&lt;br /&gt;
CONCORD rats have uniform resists and fire missiles. EDENCOM rats have lowest thermal resist and fire chain lightning, which bounces to nearby enemy or friendly targets indiscriminately. Battleships start off damaged. All rats are clearly named in accordance with their singular role. Damage types appear to be random. No remote repair.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable sortable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Arrester Marshal Disparu Troop || Battleship || DPS, EWAR || Webs (15km) || High || Any || Omni || Does high alpha damage with a slow fire rate. Loses a lot of damage against small, fast targets. Stay away from blue clouds. Short-range web can pretty much be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Attacker Marshal Disparu Troop || Battleship || DPS || - || Very High || Any || Omni || Does a lot of alpha damage with a slow fire rate. Kill before it repairs itself too much.&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Drainer Marshal Disparu Troop || Battleship || EWAR || Neuts || Very High || Any || Omni || Very strong long-range neuts and high alpha damage, kill quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Skybreaker Disparu Troop || Frigate || AOE DPS || - || Low || EM, Kinetic || Thermal || Not really a threat, surprisingly strong active tank for a frigate, often screens larger ships, can be annoying for drone ships due to chain lightning. Often damages friendly ships.&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Stormbringer Disparu Troop || Cruiser || AOE DPS || - || Moderate || Kinetic, EM || Thermal || Pretty tanky, doesn&amp;#039;t do much damage, often screens battleships, annoying for drone ships due to chain lightning. Often damages friendly ships.&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Thunderchild Disparu Troop || Frigate || AOE DPS || - || High || Kinetic, EM || Thermal || Does a lot of damage with a decent fire rate and can quickly defang careless drone users. Starts off damaged.&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Dangers ==&lt;br /&gt;
In most cases, this is an extremely high-damage room. All enemies will apply at least some of their damage, and support ships will usually deal most or all of their full damage. The webbing and painting ships will massively increase incoming damage, and stumbling into a blue cloud can spell death. Drones can also quickly die if in range of the chain lightning.&lt;br /&gt;
== Tips ==&lt;br /&gt;
EWAR Pacifiers are fragile and enable the bigger ships to do far more damage. Clear them quickly. The battleships have around a 65km range, so turning around and outranging them at the beginning of a room is a good way to safely clear smaller ships. Battleships spawn damaged, so clear them as quickly as practicable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Sansha&amp;#039;s Nation (&amp;quot;Devoted&amp;quot;) =&lt;br /&gt;
This room&amp;#039;s similar to Angels, but usually easier. Enemies will solely deal EM and thermal damage through lasers. Most of the damage comes from the cruisers, which have poor tracking and are slow with no webs, but have good range and strong shield tanks. They also have heavy neuting up close. Unlike with Angels, there are no &amp;quot;Elite&amp;quot; variants. There&amp;#039;s only 1 cruiser-type enemy.&lt;br /&gt;
== Enemy Profiles ==&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Fisher || Frigate || EWAR || Webs || Low || EM, Thermal || EM || Webs up close, annoying for drone users&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Herald || Frigate || EWAR || Weapon and Missile Disruption || Moderate || EM, Thermal || EM || Disruption can be annoying for missile and turret ships. Irrelevant for drone ships&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Knight || Cruiser || DPS, EWAR || Strong Neuts, Webs || High || EM, Thermal || EM || Slow with bad tracking, but has a lot of range and strong neuts and webs up close. The main threat in Sansha rooms&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Lookout || Frigate || EWAR || Sensor Damps || Low || EM, Thermal || EM || Mostly irrelevant, but annoying in large numbers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Priest || Frigate || Logistics || Remote Shield Boosts || Low || EM, Thermal || EM || Stays at range and gives shield reps to other rats. Kill to speed up clear time against cruisers&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Smith || Frigate || EWAR || Neuts || Moderate || EM, Thermal || EM || Thin frigate that neuts almost as much as Devoted Knights. Kill to reduce cap pressure&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Torchbearer || Frigate || EWAR || Target Paints || Low || EM, Thermal || EM || Thin painting frigate&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Devoted Trapper || Frigate || EWAR || Scrams || Low || EM, Thermal || EM || Thin scram figate&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Dangers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While they&amp;#039;re slow and have bad tracking, Devoted Knights still deal a lot of damage. Additionally, Devoted Hunters do a surprising amount of damage for their size. Rampant disruption can make things difficult for missile and turret ships, especially if there are Devoted Priests. Devoted Smiths neut a lot.&lt;br /&gt;
== Tips ==&lt;br /&gt;
Hunters and Smiths are fragile targets and can be destroyed quickly to reduce tank or neut pressure. All other frigates are similarly thin. The only tanky targets are the cruisers, and those can easily be kited due to their bad tracking and lack of long-range webs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Drifters and Sleepers =&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most common enemies to face in the abyss, Drifters and their suborned Ephialtes and Sleeper drones are characterized by having a decent amount of EHP on a large number of reasonably fast-moving targets, with many, many possible combinations of the 3 types of enemies. These rooms aren&amp;#039;t a threat to most tanks outside of Karybdis Tyrannos, but feature lots of EWAR that can lean heavily in one direction and lots of EHP to chew through. Sleepers all have remote armor reps; Ephialtes and Drifters do not. Sleepers are armor-tanked without shields, while Drifters and Ephialtes are shield-tanked. Drifters spawn damaged and regenerate over time. Needless to say, Drifters and Sleepers in the abyss are far less dangerous than their non-abyss variants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Enemy Profiles ==&lt;br /&gt;
=== Drifters ===&lt;br /&gt;
Far less dangerous than non-abyss Drifters, these enemies nevertheless pose a threat, especially in Karybdis Tyrannos (Drifter battleship) rooms. The battleship does a lot of damage with enough range to cover nearly the entire room, and attempts to quickly pull range into a 65km orbit. If it gets near a tracking pylon, or spawns in a room with a lot of blue clouds, or has a lot of webbing and painting support, its damage can quickly become deadly. Maintaining high transversal is absolutely critical in Karybdis rooms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drifter cruisers, on the other hand, make for convenient targets due to their large size and close orbit range. They deal moderate but not extreme damage. Just be wary of Entanglement cruisers targeting your drones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All Drifters spawn damaged and will repair themselves over time. They&amp;#039;re primarily shield tanked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fun fact: Karybdis Tyrannos is one of the only 2 abyssal enemies to have a unique variant with different stats in every tier, the other being the rogue drone Overmind battleship.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Ephialtes ===&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the Circadian Seekers and Autothysian Lancers of k-space, Ephialtes drones don&amp;#039;t deal much damage, but are fast with small signatures for cruisers and spawn in large numbers. Ephialtes rooms are an application check: if your weapons or drones don&amp;#039;t apply well to small and fast targets, you could time out. Due to the large numbers they spawn in, Ephialtes also tend to lean heavily towards one or two forms of EWAR, creating heavy pressure on some fits. They&amp;#039;re a good example of why having any glaring weakness in a fit can be deadly in high tiers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ephialtes have flat 10% resists, making them a great opportunity to use a bonused damage type rather than a weather-friendly one (e.g., kinetic on a Cerberus or Gila, and Augmented drones rather than navy ones). Some of them will also switch to attacking drones and can burn them down surprisingly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Ephialtes Spearfisher || Cruiser || EWAR || Scrams || Low || Omni || Omni, low || Can ignore unless MWD-fit.&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Sleepers ===&lt;br /&gt;
Sleepers are all armor tanked with no shield layer at all, and all have some form of remote armor repair similar to Triglavians, though Lucid Preservers have a stronger version. Abyssal sleepers are considerably weaker than their wormhole and Pochven variants, and don&amp;#039;t pose a DPS threat to most ships. They also don&amp;#039;t have much EHP aside from Lucid Deepwatchers. However, their EWAR, especially neuts, can pressure fits if unchecked. Sleepers deal primarily EM/thermal damage, with some additional kinetic/explosive missile damage. They have decently high omni-resists, meaning that weather resist penalty takes priority.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sleepers will partially switch to attack drones. This can be annoying due to Upholder and Warden webs. Sleepers do a surprising amount of damage to drones due to their EM/thermal damage preference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Webs (Wardens and Upholders) are high priority in Karybdis rooms, as they do not-good things to your speed, which allows Karybdis to do not-good things to your &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;ship&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt; pod.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Possible Room Combinations ==&lt;br /&gt;
=== Big Cruiser and/or Frigate Blob ===&lt;br /&gt;
This room has a lot of different variations featuring different combinations of Drifters, Ephialtes, and Sleeper cruisers and frigates. No battleships are present here. Nothing in this room type deals significant damage, but the room does tend to have a lot of EWAR and a lot of EHP to get through. For that reason, it&amp;#039;s important to prioritize the biggest EWAR threats to your fit (probably neuts, followed by webs in a drone ship and disruption in a turret/missile ship). It&amp;#039;s also important to always be shooting something. In the absence of EWAR threats, Drifters and Sleepers should be prioritized over Ephialtes, as Drifters start off damaged and Sleepers have remote reps. Drifter cruisers make for good targets, as they&amp;#039;re big and tend to follow you around closely. Ephialtes have flat 10% resists, making them a good opportunity to use a bonused damage type that doesn&amp;#039;t match the weather penalty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the room will switch to shooting your drones, which can be difficult to deal with if there are a lot of webbing ships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Karybdis Tyrannos ===&lt;br /&gt;
One of the &amp;quot;boss rooms&amp;quot; of the abyss, this room features a main Drifter battleship (Karybdis Tyrannos, aka &amp;quot;Karen&amp;quot;) with supporting Drifter, Ephialtes, and/or Sleeper EWAR cruisers. Karen&amp;#039;s tracking is mediocre, but it has enough range to cover nearly the entire room, and can deal very dangerous wrecking shots. The battleship will try to burn away from the player into a 65km orbit, which often brings it to the very edge of the boundary. If there are Ephialtes Lancers, the battleship might follow one of them around instead, which will bring it very close to the player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this room, it&amp;#039;s important to prioritize EWAR threats correctly. Start by clearing as many neuts as you need for your fit to handle the rest (you&amp;#039;ll learn this threshold with practice). Then focus on webs, followed by paints. Webs and paints will make it far easier for Karen to damage you. Getting into a close orbit on Karen can mitigate most or all of its damage, but that&amp;#039;s not always feasible unless you spawn in a white cloud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure to stay out of blue clouds, and keep Karen away from tracking pylons. Either one could easily be deadly for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Lucid Deepwatchers ===&lt;br /&gt;
This room&amp;#039;s boring. It isn&amp;#039;t dangerous to most fits damage-wise, but has a lot of EHP to clear and is a DPS check for fits. The room features a number of slow Lucid Deepwatcher battleships with possible support ships. Tiers 1 and 2 have a single battleship, Tiers 3 and 4 have 2, T5 has 3, and T6 has 4. Occasionally, 1 fewer battleship will spawn than normal, but there will be more support ships to compensate. Sleeper support ships will remote repair the battleships, so it&amp;#039;s important to clear them first. Ephialtes support ships can usually be ignored, as they don&amp;#039;t have remote reps and the battleships will repair each other. The battleships start off damaged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deepwatchers have terrible tracking, but can deal a surprising amount of damage if you sit still and they start chaining shots. They also fire extremely slow missiles with very long flight times. It&amp;#039;s usually more than enough to just orbit the gate. It&amp;#039;s critical to always be shooting something in this room to avoid timer problems. This room&amp;#039;s a great place to overheat your weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
= Rogue Drones =&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most common enemy types in the abyss, rogue drones are found in both their own rooms and in Triglavian rooms as support craft. Specifically, rogue drone frigates (Tessellas) will act as support for Triglavian spawns, but rogue drone battlecruisers and battleships are restricted to their own special rooms. Overmind battleships are one of the &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; spawns in the abyss, and are one of the 2 enemies with a unique variant with different stats in each tier (the other being Karybdis Tyrannos). In tiers 1 through 4, the Overmind has no EWAR. In 5 and 6, it has a 15km web.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rogue drone frigates and Overminds have varied resist profiles, while battlecruisers have lowest EM and explosive resists, similar to Gallente T2 hulls. Just do the weather resist penalty damage type.&lt;br /&gt;
== Enemy Profiles ==&lt;br /&gt;
=== Frigates (Tessellas) ===&lt;br /&gt;
Tessellas are very weak, extremely flimsy rogue drone frigates that can appear in their own (easy) room, along with acting as support in other rogue drone and Triglavian rooms. The only somewhat dangerous Tessellas are the EWAR variants, as they make dealing with larger and more dangerous enemies more difficult. &amp;quot;Lance&amp;quot; Tessellas deal more damage at greater range than &amp;quot;Needle&amp;quot; ones. While individual Tessellas are weak, they can deal a surprising amount of damage if a lot of them get on top of you, especially if they&amp;#039;re shooting into your resist hole. Fortunately, Tessellas are flimsy and easily taken out by a Deviant Automata Suppressor, and will sometimes stop moving if one of them dies. If the drones spawn next to a short-range suppressor, the room might even be over by the time you start moving!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All Tessellas have standard T1 resist profiles, with low EM and high explosive shield resists, and high EM and low explosive armor resists. However, they&amp;#039;re all so flimsy that damage type is pretty much irrelevant against them. Logi Tessellas (Fieldweaver and Plateforger) have no resists at all.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Battlecruisers (Tesseras) ===&lt;br /&gt;
Rogue drone battlecruisers are designed differently from all other enemies in the abyss, in that they have 4000 (effectively unlimited) tracking and deal ludicrous damage, but only within a short range (2km optimal + 6km falloff). They also have bad agility, but high speed (the fastest version, Blastgrip, goes 900 m/s). It&amp;#039;s critical to keep moving and keep your distance in this room (at least 11km if possible). If Tesseras do manage to land shots, frigates will die almost instantly and most cruisers will turn to paste soon after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These battlecruisers often spawn with support frigates, specifically Snarecasters (webs). Clear these first to avoid getting tied down and shredded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tesseras are a prime example of why having any resist hole is a bad idea in the abyss. If numerous Tesseras of one damage type spawn, it can be fatal if that damage is the one you have a hole for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tesseras have a unique form of drone aggro. Only a single Tessera will ever attack player drones at a given time, and that Tessera won&amp;#039;t change until it&amp;#039;s destroyed. If a Tessera starts shooting your drones and you recall them, that same Tessera will switch back to shooting your drones when you relaunch them. If flying a drone ship, always prioritize the Tessera shooting your drones if there aren&amp;#039;t Snarecaster frigates left on grid. Even a single Tessera will still shred drones, so recall the one being shot the moment it starts taking damage.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Battleship (Overmind) ===&lt;br /&gt;
The Overmind, also known as the baked potato. It&amp;#039;s a rogue drone battleship that spawns with rogue drone frigates for support. The Overmind is fairly slow and has bad tracking, but can project damage out to a decent range, and can do a lot of damage if it does land hits. It deals kinetic and thermal damage, and has its lowest resists in thermal, followed by kinetic. Orbiting the Overmind up close is a good way to mitigate damage, but this is difficult at tiers 5 and 6 due to the web it gets at those tiers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Overmind is primarily armor tanked, and usually the slowest room to complete due to how much EHP it has. The Overmind&amp;#039;s large size and low speed makes it a good candidate for overheating weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before starting on the Overmind, it&amp;#039;s important to clear certain support frigates. Snarecaster (web) and Spotlighter (paint) Tessellas will help the Overmind apply damage. It&amp;#039;s critical to clear Fieldweaver (shield logi) and Plateforger (armor logi) Tessellas before hitting the Overmind, as their reps will make it even tankier than it already is. Like the Lucid Deepwatchers, the Overmind&amp;#039;s a DPS check that serves to test whether your fit&amp;#039;s doing sufficient damage for its tier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with Karybdis Tyrannos, stay out of blue clouds and keep the Overmind away from tracking pylons. Deviant Automata Suppressors are helpful to clear support rogue drone frigates faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recall drones when you see the Overmind go from redboxing to yellowboxing you: that means it&amp;#039;s switching to shooting your drones. Between the high damage and the web in T5 and T6, an Overmind can easily destroy drones in just a few hits.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
= Triglavians =&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavians are the most common enemies you&amp;#039;ll face in the abyss, with the most spawn variety. It is their space, after all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All Triglavian ships are armor tanked and have remote armor reps, with some specialized variants like Renewing Leshaks and Renewing Rodivas having significantly stronger ones. All Triglavian ships exclusively deal thermal followed by explosive damage due to their Entropic Disintegrator weapon system. This weapon system is unique: Triglavian ships will start out dealing relatively low damage, and their damage will increase as they continue firing at the same target until eventually reaching 250% of its base value. Misses will not reset the damage ramp, but leaving weapon range or causing a target switch will. Triglavians don&amp;#039;t have a falloff range, just an optimal. Within this optimal, they have excellent tracking for their size. Triglavians are the reason why having a thermal hole is very bad in the abyss (this is what holds the Sacrilege back at high tiers, along with its damage being split between missiles and unbonused drones).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In one specific room, unique Vila variants of Damaviks and Vedmaks will spawn. These have weaker primary weapons than normal, but launch Vila Swarmer drones that deal consistent omni damage and can take down player drones surprisingly quickly if they start attacking them. Destroying the host ship will immediately disconnect all launcher Vila drones, so don&amp;#039;t bother targeting the Vilas themselves. This doesn&amp;#039;t apply to actual rogue drone frigates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavians are inherently weakest against explosive damage, but their resists are high enough that weather penalty takes priority. Triglavians will sometimes spawn with rogue drone Tessella frigates as support.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many Triglavian ships will anchor on the ship they&amp;#039;re remote repping. You can exploit this by outranging the anchor to reset the Triglavian damage ramp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Enemy Profiles ==&lt;br /&gt;
=== Damaviks ===&lt;br /&gt;
Damaviks can be found in every Triglavian room aside from Leshaks, and often spawn alongside rogue drone frigates. Damaviks don&amp;#039;t deal much damage on their own, but can be tricky to deal with in conjunction with larger ships due to having a lot of different EWAR. A lot of weapon and guidance disrupting Damaviks can also be tricky for turret and missile ships, as Damaviks are small targets and remote repair each other. Outranging a Damavik will cause it to activate its MWD to burn back to you, which will increase application against it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Due to how thin they are, it&amp;#039;s often worthwhile to clear one Damavik with annoying EWAR at the very start of a room before engaging more threatening targets.&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Drekavacs ===&lt;br /&gt;
These are Triglavian battlecruisers with good range and high damage, but relatively poor tracking (they are battlecruisers, after all). They spawn damaged, but have amazing remote repairs (half as powerful as Renewing Leshaks and Rodivas- the strongest RR enemies in the abyss- and equivalent to Leshaks), especially considering they&amp;#039;re not a specialized logistics spawn. Drekavacs tend to spawn with Kikimoras and Damaviks as support, which throws a lot of EWAR into the mix and can confuse inexperienced pilots. Drekavacs will not spawn alongside Vedmaks or Leshaks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#039;s vital to eliminate Drekavacs as quickly as possible, unless targeting them will get you killed. Their remote reps will make taking down other targets take a very long time. The one exception to this is destroying one EWAR Damavik at the start of the room, but even then, just switch to a Drekavac if they start landing reps on the Damavik before you destroy it.&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Striking Drekavac || Battlecruiser || DPS || - || High || Thermal, Explosive || Explosive || Does more damage. Kill quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Kikimoras ===&lt;br /&gt;
These are Triglavian destroyers. Similar to Damaviks, Kikimoras have several EWAR variants and have a high MWD speed and low orbit speed. However, they deal significantly more damage with stronger remote reps. They can project damage out to 25km with excellent tracking. Notably, Kikimoras will never neut.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kikimoras can spawn in rooms with Damaviks, Drekavacs, and Rodivas. They can also appear on their own. They will not spawn alongside Vedmaks or Leshaks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If Kikimoras are the largest targets in a room, prioritizing them is almost always the right call. If a lot of Kikimoras get full ramp on you, your tank can easily break. As usual, clearing an EWAR Damavik before starting the room proper can be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable sortable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Tangling Kikimora || Destroyer || DPS, EWAR || Webs || High || Thermal, Explosive || Explosive || Makes damage harder to avoid, clear quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Leshaks ===&lt;br /&gt;
Like Tesseras, Leshak rooms are designed counterintuitively to what you might expect from battleships in the abyss. For starters, Leshaks might be battleships, but they spawn so badly damaged that they can each be cleared in seconds once you start applying damage. The problem is actually starting to apply damage to them. Similar to other Triglavians, Leshaks have MWDs. But instead of trying to chase you like other Triglavians, Leshaks will use their MWDs to starburst and try to burn away from you as fast as possible in different directions while remote repairing each other and shooting you. This doesn&amp;#039;t apply to Starving and Tangling variants, which will try to follow you around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of remote repairs, Leshaks have the strongest remote reps in the abyss, with Renewing Leshaks repping the same amount as Rodivas and twice as much as Drekavacs, and all other Leshaks repairing just as much as Drekavacs. Left unchecked, a room of Leshaks will rep each other up quickly and massively increase clear time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This makes Leshak rooms a test of damage projection, mobility, and using the environment. Player ships need to have the range to hit Leshaks and the mobility to get between distant groups of them. White clouds are very helpful for this, and can make a Leshak room among the fastest clears in the abyss. On the flip side, flying a slow close-range ship without white clouds can make a Leshak room extremely long and a real timeout threat. Leshak rooms are a good example of why blaster ships like the Deimos aren&amp;#039;t good in high tiers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On top of the starbursting and remote reps, Leshak rooms have the strongest neuting in the abyss via Starving Leshaks. Just a few of these can zap a HAC&amp;#039;s capacitor dry in just a handful of cycles. Blinding Leshaks also have strong sensor damps, and will massively reduce your lock range while burning away from you. Tangling Leshaks are the easiest Leshaks to deal with, as their webs only reach 12km and they&amp;#039;ll follow you around instead of burning away from you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Target priority in a Leshak room is usually Renewing, then Starving, then Blinding, then everything else. The exception to this is when there are a lot of Starvings (shoot them until your cap&amp;#039;s under control), or when you&amp;#039;re in a drone ship (tell the drones to engage a Blinding before you lose lock due to the damps). Drone ships are the best suited to Leshak rooms due to drone auto-attack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leshaks often spawn with rogue drone support frigates, but will never spawn alongside any other Triglavian ships.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Rodivas ===&lt;br /&gt;
While every Triglavian ship has some form of remote armor reps, these are dedicated remote repair cruisers. Interestingly, they still have (weak) entropic disintegrators for damage, whereas player Rodivas and Zarmazds can&amp;#039;t even fit them. Rodiva remote reps are the strongest in the abyss, equivalent only to those of Renewing Leshaks, the other dedicated Triglavian remote repair ship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rodivas will only spawn alongside Damaviks, Kikimoras, and rogue drone frigates. These spawns will have fewer enemies and are easier than ones without Rodivas. The Rodiva + Tessella spawn is probably the easiest room in the abyss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best target to prioritize in a Rodiva room is almost always the Rodivas due to how tanky they make every other enemy. Rodivas are pretty fast and decently big, and like to close range, so are easy to apply damage against. They also aren&amp;#039;t all that tanky themselves.&lt;br /&gt;

| Renewing Rodiva || Cruiser || Logistics || Remote armor reps || Moderate || Thermal, Explosive || Explosive || Tied for strongest remote reps in the abyss&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Vedmaks ===&lt;br /&gt;
Vedmak rooms can be deceptively tricky in high tiers, and may also feature Damaviks and Tessellas. Vedmak rooms won&amp;#039;t have any other additional enemy types. Vedmaks combine high damage, high projection, good application, strong neuts, remote repair, and good tanks in a very mobile package, and often spawn alongside EWAR Triglavian and rogue drone frigates. Their ramp also makes their damage output even nastier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The right targets to prioritize in Vedmak rooms are almost always Starving Vedmaks. While clearing one EWAR Damavik at the start of a room is usually a good idea, it can be deadly in high-tier Vedmak rooms. It&amp;#039;s difficult to reset Vedmak ramp due to their MWDs, but white clouds still make it very possible.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Vila Damaviks and Vedmaks ===&lt;br /&gt;
Triglavian &amp;quot;Vila&amp;quot; ships are unique in that they launch drones to supplement their primary weapons. These &amp;quot;Vila Swarmer&amp;quot; drones deal low but consistent omni-damage. In exchange, the ships themselves are less dangerous than their regular counterparts. Vila Vedmaks deal only half the damage of their regular counterparts, while Vila Damaviks do a quarter. However, Vila Swarmers can make quick work of player drones, especially if there are webs on grid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vila drones themselves aren&amp;#039;t ever worth targeting, as they all disconnect when their host ship is destroyed. However, Vila Swarmers are flimsy, and fighting near a Short-Range Deviant Automata Suppressor can destroy Vila drones faster than they&amp;#039;re replenished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vila Vedmaks and Vila Damaviks will only spawn alongside other Vila Vedmaks and Vila Damaviks, but may have additional rogue drone frigate support. Every Vila ship has a regular counterpart except the Blinding Vila Damavik, which is the only Damavik type that uses sensor damps, and the Shining Vila Damavik, which is the only Damavik that uses target painters. There is no Starving Vila Damavik. In fact, no Vila ships will ever neut, as there&amp;#039;s no Starving Vila Vedmak either.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Basic geography of New Eden==&lt;br /&gt;
New Eden consists of roughly 7800 star systems, with over 5400 connected by permanent stargates (forming so-called K-space) and the remaining systems by transient wormholes (known as J-space).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
K-space is divided up into 64 interconnected regions with a 65th region (Pochven) isolated from the rest.  Regions are further subdivided into constellations, but these have little impact on gameplay.  23 regions are part of empire space, divided up between the four empires and CONCORD, and are the game&amp;#039;s high-sec and low-sec spaces.  The remaining 41 regions form null-sec and are player controlled.  Pochven&amp;#039;s 27 systems are also interconnected by gates, but the rest of K-space is only reachable via wormholes and filaments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
J-space systems are divided up into various wormhole classes, C1 to C6 being the main classes.  The mechanics of navigating these are nearly identical with only the four Drifter wormholes having wormholes that appear directly on the Overview when in connected K-space systems.  All other wormholes need to be scanned down as cosmic signatures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Navigating_New_Eden#Hisec|Sections 5 to 9]] for further descriptions of the different spaces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Jumping from system to system==&lt;br /&gt;
There are multiple mechanisms for jumping between star systems:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Star gates&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; are the main mechanism to jump between different systems in K-space, i.e. outside of wormhole/J-space.  All ships in-game and even capsules can jump through star gates.  One needs to be within 2500 m of a gate to jump through it and on reaching the other side, the jumping ship is placed around 12 km from the gate, with a 60s cloak and invulnerability timer.  Given the correct distance, the jump will occur except when&lt;br /&gt;
# (Rarely) a server error occurs -- the player is informed that &amp;quot;traffic control&amp;quot; is preventing the jump.  Generally a second attempt at the jump command will result in a successful jump.&lt;br /&gt;
# The player has a 60s weapons timer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Wormholes&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; are the main mechanism to jump between different systems in J-space/wormhole space.  These are temporary connections, lasting no more than a day, covered in more detail below in [[Navigating_New_Eden#Wormhole_Space|the section on wormholes]].  One needs to be with 5000 m of a wormhole to jump through it and on reaching the other side, the jumping ship is placed roughly 5 km from the wormhole, with a 60s cloak and invulnerability timer. There are no aggression timers, but there is a polarization timer, allowing no more than two jumps through a wormhole inside any four-minute interval.  The polarization timer applies to the capsule, not the ship -- so reshipping does not change the polarization timer state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Jump filaments&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; provide a means of jumping large distances within K-space, but the destination system is always randomly determined.  All jump filaments have a cool-down timer, preventing use of another filament within 15 minutes of the first.  Most filaments can transport multiple ships, up to the number listed in their name.  This means that you need to be in a fleet to use these - right-click at the center of your capacitor indicator and select &amp;quot;Pilot&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;Form Fleet&amp;quot; to place your character in a fleet with just yourself.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The table below shows the different jump filaments available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Table 7: Jump filaments.  ## will be the number of ships that can jump with a given filament.  Values can include 1, 5, 15, and 25.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Use of filaments is a powerful gameplay tool - some would say too powerful. The tactics of using filaments is covered in more detail in sections discussing [[Navigating_New_Eden#Entering_Null_sec|entering null sec]] and [[Navigating_New_Eden#The_Pochven_Express|Pochven]].  Note that travel filaments cannot be used in wormhole systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Ansible jump gates&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; are the player-installed and owned equivalent of star gates.  They can only be installed in null sec space and one ansible jump gate connect to another, generally many systems away on the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; star-gate map.  Access may be controlled and tolls may be charged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Interstellar shipcasters&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; are faction warfare structures installed in one system per faction:&lt;br /&gt;
* Mehatoor (Amarr)&lt;br /&gt;
* Onnamon (Caldari)&lt;br /&gt;
* Intaki (Gallente)&lt;br /&gt;
* Amo (Minmatar) &lt;br /&gt;
These structures work in one direction only, from the ship caster in the direction of up to three beacons, potentially in different systems.  The beacons are player-installed and can be attacked and destroyed by players from opposing factions.  The end destination from any given ship caster rotates between the different beacons installed.  Access to the shipcasters is restricted to players signed up to the corresponding faction.  Camping the beacons by opposing players is possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Cynos&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Jump Drives&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; are ship-based inter-system jumping mechanisms.  Capitals, Jump Freighters and Black Ops Battleships are the only ship hulls that have the jump drive capability.  Jumps are made to either deployable cynosural (or cyno for short) beacons or to cyno fields lit by ships such as Ventures (for the Rorqual) or Covert Ops (for Black Ops Battleships).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Titans, Black Ops Battleships and Rorquals can bring other ships with them through bridging of fleet members.  Fleet members need to manually activate the bridge.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Black Ops Battleships and Rorquals can also bring other ships with them using conduits where up to 30 qualifying ships within a 10km radius are automatically jumped to the cyno.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Navigation tools==&lt;br /&gt;
There are numerous tools to aid in inter-system navigation in EVE Online:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;in-game map&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; provides a wealth of statistics that can inform route planning.  The most useful are&lt;br /&gt;
* Ship kills in the last hour. &lt;br /&gt;
* The average number of pilots in space over the last 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
* The average number of pilots docked up, over the last 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
Once a route has been set in-game, the in-game map will highlight it, making it easy to check for conditions along the route.  Importantly, it provides a more up-to-date and accurate view of these statistics than any of the external tools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[https://evemaps.dotlan.net &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;DOTLAN&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;] is an external tool that presents a flat 2D map of K-space.  The flat, per-region presentation is much more useful for understanding the topology of EVE&amp;#039;s K-space than the confusing 3-D presentation in the in-game map.  Just like the in-game map, it can overlay with various statistics by pulling from an external API (application programming interface) called ESI (EVE Swagger Interface).  Unlike the in-game map, these statistics are based off delayed data, perhaps up to a one-hour delay for some kills.  The statistics include:&lt;br /&gt;
* Ship and pod kills in the last hour or last 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
* Jumps per hour or last 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
* NPC kills in the last hour or the last 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
It also provides a wealth of other (static) data on individual K-space systems, covering mining resources, stations, sun type, etc. It also has route mapping capabilities, presenting the number of system kills on the selected route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;J-space navigation&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, the player and/or their corporation has to build their own maps.  Two tools frequently used for mapping wormhole connections are [https://tripwire.eve-apps.com/ &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Tripwire&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;] and [https://pathfinder.lost-in-w.space/ &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Pathfinder&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;].  Each has their own strengths.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For navigation to/from Pochven via wormholes rather than filaments, consider [https://evemetro.com/ &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;EVE Metro&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;].  Its route mapper considers scanned Pochven wormhole connection along with Signal Cartel&amp;#039;s Thera mampping data.  The routing function also accepts non-Pochven end-points.  All Signal Cartel members have free access on login.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a number of dedicated &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;threat assessment tools&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[https://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/ &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Eve Gatecamp Check&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;] provides a combined routing and presentation of kill reports, with a focus on gate camps.  In particular, it not only presents the number of recent kills in a system, it also check to see if they were at gates and whether or not smartbombs and/or Heavy Interdiction Cruisers were used.  All Signal Cartel members have free access, on login, to advanced features.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[https://zkillboard.com/ &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Killboard&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;] can also be queried for recent kills per system.  It gives a lot of detail on the location of the kills, the pilots and ships involved, and the long-term kill statistics as a function of the day of the week or the hour.  Note that some gate-camp players will go to considerable length to keep their kills off zKillboard, so as to not tip off any other players that may go through their camp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Allison&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;] is the Signal Cartel AI co-pilot.  If given access to your character&amp;#039;s location, it provides an easy interface to other tools such as zKillboard and DOTLAN.  Other navigation capabilities in Allison are explored [[ENG:The_Signal_Cartel_Official_Guide_to_Co-Pilot_(Allison)|here]] - these include mapping and routing functions, using any wormhole data you&amp;#039;ve gathered while traveling through J-space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Planning and setting your route==&lt;br /&gt;
===Basic in-game mechanisms===&lt;br /&gt;
If one right-clicks on any system name, celestial name or station name nearly anywhere in-game two or three routing options appear in the drop-down menu:  &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:RoutingTool.png|thumb|Figure 1: Route from Jita to Amarr as selected by the in-game routing tool with &amp;quot;Prefer Safer&amp;quot; option selected.]]&lt;br /&gt;
* Set Destination - for setting that location as the first destination in the routing tool.&lt;br /&gt;
* Add Waypoint - for adding that location as an extra waypoint or final destination in the routing tool.&lt;br /&gt;
* Avoid/Do Not Avoid (for systems only) - for adding or removing a star system from the routing tool&amp;#039;s avoidance list.&lt;br /&gt;
The resulting route selected by the routing tool is shown under the left-hand side on-screen user interface item with an A symbol.  The system listed just over the route is the next system to jump to, while the final destination is given on the bottom.  The same route is also highlighted in the in-game New Eden system map.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To adjust the results of the routing, right-click on the A symbol.  Various options are presented for adjusting the desired route, but the most commonly used are &amp;quot;Prefer Safer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Prefer Shorter&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;quot;Prefer Safer&amp;quot;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; attempts to keep the route in high-sec space as much as possible, but the algorithm can be made more or less aggressive in doing so by setting the &amp;quot;Security penalty&amp;quot; slider.  For the example shown in Figure 1, the 45-jump high-sec-only route is selected with the default penalty of 50.  Set the slider to 20 and the algorithm gives a higher weighting to shorter routes and selects the 11-jump route via Abhazon -- a low-sec system notorious for gate camps!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;quot;Prefer Shorter&amp;quot;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; will always select the shortest route, irrespective of the security status en route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Assessing traffic flows, identifying choke points===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If a pilot understands the main traffic flows and main areas of activity in a region then the risks of any given route become easier to determine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, consider the Great Wildlands.  Dotlan&amp;#039;s view of [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Great_Wildlands#jumps24 the number of jumps per system in the last 24 hours] will show that most jumps are on the western and eastern north-south corridors, with particular hot-spots around two of the systems with NPC stations, M-M3DB and E02-IK.  Switching to the view of [https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Great_Wildlands#kills24 the player ship kills in the last 24-hours] will generally show the most kills in choke-point systems such as N-RAEL or M9U-75 near the inter-region gateways or along the pipe from NIH-02 to CRXA-Y, with most of the region&amp;#039;s NPC stations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Thera and Turnur===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two systems with a large number of wormholes to K-space are Thera and Turnur.  Thera, a large J-space system, always has wormholes to roughly a dozen random systems in K-space.  Turnur, in Metropolis&amp;#039; low-sec space, has  3 wormholes to random systems in null-sec space, 2 to low-sec space and one to high-sec. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Eve-Scout Thera-Turnur-mapping.png|thumb|Sample data from Eve Scout&amp;#039;s mapping of wormhole connections from Thera and Turnur.]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The connectivity to null-sec space is particularly useful, bypassing as they do any gate camps at the entry systems to many null-sec regions.  Combined with [https://www.eve-scout.com/#/ Eve-Scout&amp;#039;s public, dynamic Thera and Turnur maps] and bookmarks, the Thera and Turnur routes are a well-used method for taking short-cuts across the map of New Eden.  See the [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|dedicated Wiki section]] for the latest guides to Thera and Turnur mapping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using Thera and Turnur is not without risk.  Because of that enhanced connectivity, one or two major low-sec alliances use Turnur as a staging system for raids.  Null-sec holes are frequently collapsed through rolling.  Thera often has camps stationed at K-space wormholes and indeed any connections close to Jita.  However, the large size of both systems, makes it difficult for any one group to lock down all wormholes or (in the case of Turnur) stargates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===The Pochven Express===&lt;br /&gt;
Gate camps permanently bubbled using mobile warp disruptors are the main impediment to travel around null-sec and in particular crossing over to low-sec or high-sec space.  The danger is particularly acute for ships without covert-ops cloaking.  The combination of one Pochven-in-bound filament and one Pochven-out-bound filament is a powerful tool for bypassing such null-sec gate camps.  This technique is known as &amp;quot;the Pochven Express&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The steps are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
# Use any Pochven in-bound filament to jump from null-sec to Pochven.&lt;br /&gt;
# Create a safe and cloak up at it.  If no cloaking device is fitted and online, create additional in-system safes.&lt;br /&gt;
# Stay cloaked or bounce around between safes for 15 minutes until the filament use timer expires.&lt;br /&gt;
# Use any Pochven out-bound filament to jump to high-sec or low-sec.&lt;br /&gt;
# Travel to your destination by conventional means.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While this scheme works with any in-bound/out-bound pair of Pochven filaments, one can influence where one jumps to on the out-bound filament through the correct selection of the in-bound filament combined with a Proximity out-bound filament.  Proximity filaments always jump to a K-space system geographically close to the Pochven system from which the jump is made.  To select the correct in-bound filament to improve the chances of a Proximity-filament jump landing close to your final destination, consider the following in conjunction with [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/annotated-pochven-map/275436 this map]:&lt;br /&gt;
* If your target is &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Caldari&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; space, select a Border filament -- all six Border systems were from Caldari space.&lt;br /&gt;
* If your target is &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Gallente&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; space, select a &amp;quot;Krai Veles&amp;quot; filament -- four of the nine systems in the Krai Veles constellation were from Gallente space.&lt;br /&gt;
* If your target is &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Amarr&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; space, select a &amp;quot;Krai Svarog&amp;quot; filament -- all four systems formally from Amarr are in the Krai Svarog constellation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By way of contrast, Glorification Devana filaments will jump to any low-sec or high-sec minor Triglavian system and these are scattered between the four empires.  This can leave the player with a long, and sometimes hazardous journey, to their final destination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other points to note:&lt;br /&gt;
* Pochven space is dangerous.  Local is delayed, just like wormhole-space.  Bubbles are allowed!  So jumping from system to system in Pochven is not advised unless fitted with a covert ops cloak.&lt;br /&gt;
* Glorification Devana filaments can be purchased in Pochven itself, from any NPC station for 10k ISK.  Docking up in an NPC station is an alternative for waiting out the 15-minute filament timer, but is much more risky than simply cloaking up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Wormhole selection and statics===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wormhole destinations are highly random, but since different wormhole classes have different static wormhole classes, the statistics for a given wormhole system are not evenly spread.  For information on what static wormhole types each class has, please see [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_space#Statics this Eve University Wiki page].  Some informal studies on the probability of a static type occurring, given the current wormhole class, have been [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/109aq5l/static_probability_by_wh_class/ reported on Reddit].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, consider a different question:  When traveling through J-space, often a player has scanned down and identified the wormholes in the system they are currently in.  No wormhole to their desired destination is available.  Which wormhole should they choose to jump into next to maximize their chances of finding the right connection in that &amp;#039;&amp;#039;next&amp;#039;&amp;#039; wormhole?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Table 8 below attempts to answer this by identifying the system types with the highest probability of a static wormhole to the desired destination.  The assumption is that availability of these statics then skews the probability distribution towards or against finding any wormhole with the desired connection destination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Ice filaments===&lt;br /&gt;
During the Winter Nexus events, ice-storm filaments are made available to players as site drops, NPC drops, login-rewards and track rewards.  The high-sec version of those filaments jump a player or group of players to a metaliminal storm in high-sec space.  The idea is to provide a fast means to travel quickly to the event sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, these filaments work from anywhere in K-space and thus can be used during the event as a low-risk means of jumping directly to high-sec space.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==The basics of warping==&lt;br /&gt;
Warping is the high-speed means of travel between two in-system locations.  Even the largest of solar systems, Thera, can be traversed in a few minutes, using this method of travel.  While in warp, a player&amp;#039;s ship is &amp;#039;&amp;#039;nearly&amp;#039;&amp;#039; invulnerable (the one exception is discussed in the next section).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The time taken to travel between any two points by warping is set by the maximum speed while in warp, called (a little misleadingly) just &amp;quot;warp speed&amp;quot; in game.  Smaller ships warp faster than larger -- warp speeds range from 20 AU/s for the Leopard shuttle down to 1.37 AU/s for titans.  (1 AU is nearly 150 million kilometers, the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun.)  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are limited options for improving warp speed:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;No skills&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; impact warp speed.&lt;br /&gt;
* Modules that improve warp speed are:&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer rigs&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, that give a 20 to 25% improvement in warp speed, at the expense of increased signature radius.&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Hyperspatial Accelerators&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; low-slot modules that increase warp speed by between 0.2 and 0.3AU.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Eifyr &amp;amp; Co. &amp;#039;Rogue&amp;#039; WS series&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; of hard wirings give warp speed improvements from 5% to 18%.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Ascendency attribute implants&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; give bonus for warp speed, up to a maximum of 62.17% for the High-Grade set.&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Halcyon B Series of daily award boosters&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; give a time-limited boost to warp speed of up to 5%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To get into warp, some conditions need to be met on-grid:&lt;br /&gt;
* Your velocity should be at least 75% of your &amp;#039;&amp;#039;current&amp;#039;&amp;#039; maximum speed.  If your maximum speed is increased by a microwarpdrive or an after-burner or is decreased by webbing then the critical velocity is 75% of that speed, not your nominal ship-fit maximum.&lt;br /&gt;
* Your direction of travel should be within a few degrees (perhaps 5° or less) of the line towards the target of your warp.&lt;br /&gt;
* Your warp drive is not destabilized by warp scrambers, warp disruptors, etc.  The various methods to interfere with your warp drive are discussed below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The time taken to achieve 75% of current velocity in the right direction, from a standing stop, is exactly the align time and is listed in the fitting window.  Two important points to note:&lt;br /&gt;
# Because of the way the game is architected, the actual align time is the listed align time rounded up to the nearest second.  So listed align times of 1.01 and 1.99 seconds give an actual align time of 2s.&lt;br /&gt;
# The actual direction the ship is facing when starting has no impact on the time to enter warp.  The speed and direction of travel does.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Align time is set by ship agility and the factors that impact this are listed in [[Navigating_New_Eden#Propulsion_modules_and_other_relevant_ship_equipment|this section]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To enter warp, capacitor is used.  The amount needed depends on the length of the warp.  If the ship has insufficient capacitor then it will fail to complete the warp, but come out of warp at a distance dependent on the available capacitor.  Factors that impact the amount of capacitor needed are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
* The skill &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Warp Drive Operation&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; reduces the capacitor needed for a given warp distance by 10% for each skill level.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Eifyr &amp;amp; Co. &amp;#039;Rogue&amp;#039; WD series&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; of hard wirings reduce the capacitor needed by anywhere between 2 and 12%.&lt;br /&gt;
* Ships like covert ops have skill-based bonuses for reduced capacitor need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===How to interfere with a warp===&lt;br /&gt;
Ships in warp are &amp;#039;&amp;#039;nearly&amp;#039;&amp;#039; invulnerable to attack from other ships until they arrive at their new location on-grid.  The mere act of entering warp also breaks the targeting lock of hostile ships.  So modules, deployables and techniques that either prevent a ship from going into warp or pull a ship out of warp prematurely form a central hunting technique in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Bumping || A technique where a hostile pilot rams a ship attempting to align at high speed.  This can prevent a ship from aligning direction well enough to warp. || 0 km || A ship moving quickly is very hard to target for bumping.&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For warp disruption or warp scrambling modules to prevent warping, their strength must exceed the warp core strength of the ship attempting to warp.  Most ships have a warp core strength of zero, ships such as the Venture and the Metamorphosis have an innate warp core strength of +2.  For all ships, this can be boosted by +2 for a limited period of 10 or more seconds by activating a Warp Core Stabilizer, if installed.  (Note that Warp Core Stabilizers come with significant drawbacks: halving of drone bandwidth and maximum target lock range.) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once in warp, the hunted ship is much safer.  However, as always in EVE Online, no tactic is risk free:&lt;br /&gt;
* It is possible to &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;smart-bomb a ship mid-warp&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;.  Every 1s server tick, EVE Online calculates the position of a ship in warp.  If another ship detonates a smart bomb within range of that position at the right server tick, the warping ship will take the usual smart-bomb damage.  This can be fatal to low-tanked ships like shuttles.  Note that the attacker will have determine the right locations mid-warp using their own dummy runs and therefore this method really on works on ship classes with little or no variation, most particularly shuttles.  Even the use of a cheap Eifyr &amp;amp; Co. &amp;#039;Rogue&amp;#039; WS-01 implant by the warping pilot will negate this tactic.&lt;br /&gt;
* The main risk arises &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;after leaving warp&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;.  The hunter may try to guess the on-grid location where the warp will finish and attempt to intercept.  A classic example is using the system&amp;#039;s star as an emergency warp-out point.  Since the star is always present on the overview, it is a common choice for fleeing pilots.  Good hunters will observe the direction of alignment to determine where the hunted ship is fleeing to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Can I see it?  Can I warp to it?  Locating ships and other objects==&lt;br /&gt;
For the New Eden explorer, tactical awareness at the system level is probably the key factor to survival.  Once a hunter is on-grid with your ship, the outcome of destruction or escape is often pre-determined.  Off-grid and in-system, the outcomes are very much more fluid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is because three key questions have complex answers:&lt;br /&gt;
# Can I see the ships of any other players in-system?  &lt;br /&gt;
# Can they see me?&lt;br /&gt;
# Can they warp to my position?&lt;br /&gt;
The answers to these questions depend on a multiplicity of tools and mechanisms, each returning different types and granularity of information, each leaking information to your opponents.  Table 5 gives a brief summary of each.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Table 5: In-system intel tools and mechanisms, with their characteristics&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! Tool/mechanism !! Information given !! Location granularity !! Information leaked to opponents&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Local chat || Character names of in-system pilots || In-system or not || Own character name visible&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| D-scan || Ship name and type || Angle to within 5 degrees; distance to within 0.1AU; all inside a 14.4AU radius of current location || If a given ship is within 14.4AU, they can D-scan you if uncloaked (*)&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| Combat probing || Ship type || Accurate enough to enable warp-in to within 2500m of the located ship || Presence of combat probes will alert other players to your presence and intent&lt;br /&gt;

| Overview and on-grid view || Character name, ship name and type, weapon types and other visual fit data || Accurate enough to obtain target lock || Own ship is similarly visible, if uncloaked.&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
(*) There are also a class of ships, combat recon ships, that are invisible to D-scan: the Rook, the Curse, the Lachesis, and the Huginn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Local chat===&lt;br /&gt;
For all of K-space (high-, low- and null-sec space), the local chat window shows what other pilots are in-system.  Right-clicking on their name and selecting “Information” gives some useful data: how old the character is, what is their security status, what corporation do they belong to.    Out-of-game tools such as [https://zkillboard.com/ zKillboard] and [https://localthreat.xyz/ localthreat] give further information.  zKillboard can be searched, one pilot at a time, for detail on all their kills.  localthreat provides a quick, single summary view for a list of players cut&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;pasted from local chat into that tool. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you can see other in-system ships, you can postulate which ships are being piloted by which players, what their likely current activity is and what might their offensive and defensive capabilities might be.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Local chat rarely shows who is in system in wormhole space and Pochven.  Only if somebody messages using local chat will their name appear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===D-scan===&lt;br /&gt;
(See [[Directional_Scanner_and_Overview|the Explorer&amp;#039;s Handbook section on D-scan]] for further detail on this critical tool.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D-scan is the fastest tool for identifying the existence of another ship.  Unlike local, it returns not the pilot name, but the ship name.  So, unless you are on-grid with the ship in question, then the match of pilot to a given ship is a game of guesswork.  Note also, that D-scan does not tell you if a ship is being piloted -- often cheap corvettes are abandoned without any pilots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D-scan&amp;#039;s maximum range of 14.4AU has a big impact on how conflict plays out in a large system.  With all cosmic signatures within 4AU of a celestial, a large system essentially has a number of (free space) pockets that a pilot has to warp between to determine what (uncloaked) ships are active in space.  This is even more important in space like factional warfare low sec where few run with cloaky ships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Setting the range to 1AU or less is often a good way to determine if you are about to be joined on-grid, since if you hit D-scan frequently (say more frequently than once every 10s) you will see other ships warping in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Decreasing the scan cone angle to 10 or 5 degrees is a good way to determine if another player is at a particular location.  Simply hold down the D-scan button (defaults to &amp;quot;v&amp;quot;) and then click on a location in the scan probe window, a row in the overview or a bookmark or other marker in space.  The cone quickly rotates to that direction and performs a scan.  Any ship that is flagged up by the D-scan will likely be at that location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Uniquely, there are no skills, modules, or boosters that improve D-scan effectiveness.  A 10-year EVE Online veteran has no advantage other than personal experience, over a 1-day-old character.  However, configuring the results filter to show up the desired ships and other artifacts, does make a difference in the ease of reading and utility of the results.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Scanning using combat probes===&lt;br /&gt;
If a ship is not near another object one can warp to or a bookmark then there are only two methods to warp to that ship: (a) be in a fleet with them or (b) probe down their location using combat probes.  For most players, spotting combat probes on D-scan (see below) is a sign that there are hostiles in-system and it is time to move.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speed of combat probe scanning is of vital importance.  A hunter can reduce the number of scans needed by determining the approximate location on D-scan then launching and scanning with a tight configuration, say with diameter 1AU, to locate the target ship with one sweep.  That gives the target player just a short window of roughly 10 seconds to spot the combat probes on D-scan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The target ship has a few strategies for avoiding a hunter appearing close-by, on-grid:&lt;br /&gt;
* Regularly moving between safes (see below).&lt;br /&gt;
* Cloaking up.&lt;br /&gt;
* Making it harder to scan down in a single pass, through the use of signature reduction techniques (see [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/10296/the-alpha-cloak-fact-or-fiction-as-of-nov-2022 this investigation by Nac Audene]). &lt;br /&gt;
* Moving at high-speed while on-grid.  There is usually a minimum of 15s between completion of a successful combat probe sweep and a hunter landing on grid.  If the target ship is a frigate, it can already be over 20km away from the location determined by the combat probes – outside of scram range.  To achieve that gap, the target ship needs to be continuously moving with a prop mod active, ideally in a direction out of the horizontal plane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===The overview===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(For further information on this important tool, please see [[Directional_Scanner_and_Overview#The_Overview_Window|the Explorer&amp;#039;s Handbook section on the overview]].)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The overview, with correct configuration, will show what ships are on-grid with you.  If the ship is occupied by a pilot, their name will be given alongside the ship type.  If unoccupied, the ship type will be repeated as the name.  Note that neither you nor they can warp directly to your position directly – other modes of propulsion must be used.  However, if more than 150km away, another ship can warp to a nearby object like a relic or data can or asteroid.  So a ship that is several hundred kilometers away from any object is nearly invulnerable.  Competent hunters can get around this through the quick use of combat probes…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Deadspace pockets and acceleration gates===&lt;br /&gt;
A deadspace pocket is one that cannot be warped to directly, but instead any attempt to do so will land the pilot at some fixed location on the edge or outside the pocket.  Two examples:&lt;br /&gt;
# Warping to a Drifter wormhole (marked by a beacon) will put the ship about 80km from the wormhole itself.  &lt;br /&gt;
# Many combat sites are deadspace pockets and one arrives not at the pocket, but at an acceleration gate leading to the pocket.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For both examples, the ship warping in is placed at a disadvantage.  In the former case, the ship is at risk of coming under heavy attack from Drifter battleships with long-range weapons.  For the latter, any ship already inside the deadspace pocket can, through a short-range D-scan, detect their arrival and prepare accordingly before the arriving ship can activate and come in via the acceleration gate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Safes, Bookmarks, Perches and All That==&lt;br /&gt;
Making and using bookmarks allows for much greater flexibility in where one warps to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A bookmark is simply a saved location in a given system.  It can be on an existing grid or be off any current grid.  There are two methods to creating a new bookmark:&lt;br /&gt;
# Right-click an on-grid object whose location can be saved and select save location.  Note that the location of on-grid ships cannot be saved.&lt;br /&gt;
# Hit the &amp;quot;save current location&amp;quot; hotkey (usually &amp;quot;Ctrl-b&amp;quot;), fill in the relevant details in the resulting dialog box and hit &amp;quot;Enter&amp;quot;.  The location saved is the one where you ship is during the current server tick when &amp;quot;Enter&amp;quot; is pressed.  Crucially, this allows one to save mid-warp locations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are multiple different uses for bookmarks:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Gate perches:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Many gates are more than 14.4AU from any other celestial body or structure, in other words, out of D-scan range.  Thus, warping to the gate means that a player is essentially flying blind into a [[Navigating_New_Eden#Gate_and_station_camping|choke point that may be camped]].  A previously saved bookmark within 14.4AU is a valuable &amp;quot;perch&amp;quot; from which the player can D-scan the gate and assess any possible threats there.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;On-grid perches:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Sometimes referred to as tacticals, perches on-grid with stations, gates, PVE sites, etc. can be a useful way to observe what is happening on-grid.  These are very safe if the ship is cloaked and if not combat probed, safe even if uncloaked.  &lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Data or relic site on-grid perch:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; One common use is in hacking data and relic sites.  A player can &amp;quot;bounce&amp;quot; their ship rapidly and precisely between cans by warping over and back from the on-grid perch.  This reduces vulnerability to hunters, since the player&amp;#039;s ship does not directly travel between cans by &amp;quot;slow-boating&amp;quot; (conventional on-grid movement without warping).&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Conventional safes:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Any saved location that is off-grid from other celestials, structures and sites is regarded as a &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;.  To reach such a location, other players would need to combat scan the current location of the ship.  The use of safes is essential when other players pose a threat -- which is the case in most of New Eden!&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Deep safes:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; These are safes that are more than 14.4AU from any celestial.  Unless another player spots them on D-scan while warping by or detects them via a wide-spread combat probe configuration, a player at a deep safe is effectively hidden.  Deep safes are hard to establish in small to medium-sized systems where all celestials, stations and gates are within 14.4AU of &amp;#039;&amp;#039;some&amp;#039;&amp;#039; other object.  One known method for creating deep safes in &amp;#039;&amp;#039;any&amp;#039;&amp;#039; system, is to be in an abyssal site at down-time (11 EVE time, every day).  After down-time, the player&amp;#039;s ship is placed in the system from where the abyssal filament was activated, but at a random location.  Sometimes these random locations are over 14.4AU from all other bodies and objects. &lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Instadock bookmarks:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Warping to a station can be dangerous.  The warp-in point is a position placed at roughly 2500m from the point or object that a player requested a warp to.  But stations have a docking range of 350m, leaving a potential journey of over 2000m for the ship to traverse before docking.  This period leaves a player&amp;#039;s ship vulnerable at what is a well-known choke-point.  An &amp;quot;instadock bookmark&amp;quot; is a saved location well inside the station model.  A player that warps to an instadock bookmark is always guaranteed to have a warp-in point at 0m from the station and thus any dock command will be instantaneous.  Instadock bookmarks can be created simply by saving the ship&amp;#039;s location immediately after undocking. For further insights, see [[Instadock_Bookmarks|Millener Audeles&amp;#039; Instadock Bookmarks article]] for an in-depth explanation on the mechanics and creation of instadock bookmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Instaundock (instawarp) bookmarks:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Undocking from a station can be dangerous.  After requesting a warp to another location, it can take several seconds for a ship to align and warp, during which time, the ship is vulnerable to attack and/or warp disruption or scrambling.  An &amp;quot;instaundock (instawarp) bookmark&amp;quot; is one which is more than 150km from the undock point, directly aligned with the direction of travel on undocking.  A player that warps to an instaundock bookmark will experience little or no delay between the issuing of the warp command and entering into warp.  Instaundock bookmarks are created by undocking and directing the ship along the main undock guideline for at least 150km before saving the location as a bookmark.

==Gate, station and wormhole camping==&lt;br /&gt;
===Choke points===&lt;br /&gt;
Space is BIG.  Catching other ships is hard.  So, players hang out at the natural choke points in the hope of intercepting and destroying other players&amp;#039; ships.  Such choke points include:&lt;br /&gt;
* Intersystem stargates &lt;br /&gt;
* Wormholes &lt;br /&gt;
* Station dock and undock points&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See [[Common_Camp_Locations|here]] for a list of locations frequently camped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Stargates&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you warp directly to a gate, and don’t get caught by a warp disruption bubble, you will jump the gate safely without being locked by hostile ships.  Dangers include:&lt;br /&gt;
* Warp disruption bubbles can prevent you from reaching the star gate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Smart bombs can cause damage without the launching ship target locking your ship.&lt;br /&gt;
* If you have an aggression or weapons timer (duration 60s), you cannot jump through the gate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On jumping through a gate, you will be placed at a random location roughly 12km from the stargate.  You are invulnerable through the gate cloak effect for either up to one-minute or up until player action results in the &amp;quot;breaking&amp;quot; of the gate cloak. Successful evasion depends on entering warp or recloaking and evading other players.&lt;br /&gt;
Dangers include:&lt;br /&gt;
* Your warp being disrupted by any one of a number of methods.&lt;br /&gt;
* Smart bombs after disengagement of the gate cloak.  (Note that smart bombs still cause damage for a ship re-cloaked using a cloaking module.)&lt;br /&gt;
* Being de-cloaked (when using a cloaking module) by other objects within 2000m.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Wormholes&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very similar to stargates, with two major exceptions:&lt;br /&gt;
* On jumping through a wormhole, a ship is placed roughly 5km from the wormhole exit.&lt;br /&gt;
* You and, most importantly, your enemies can jump back through a wormhole so long as you or they haven&amp;#039;t a  polaraization timer from jumping through the same wormhole twice in the last 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Station dock points&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When warping to a station with the intent of docking, any delay between coming out of warp and docking up is a point of vulnerability to attack.  Docking occurs when within 350m of the station structure.  Ship auto-piloting land roughly 20km from the station and hence are vulnerable.  Ships manually approaching a station through hitting either the dock button or the warp to button for the station will land anywhere up to 2500m from the station - again sometimes leaving distance to be traveled to reach the 350m limit.  Warping to an instadoc bookmark is the best approach to avoid this gap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also a player should issue the dock command either prior to reaching the 350m limit or immediately after.  This can be done through quick, timely application of the dock button.  Alternatively, if the station is the final waypoint or destination programmed in the in-game routing tool then engaging the autopilot &amp;#039;&amp;#039;after initiating warp&amp;#039;&amp;#039; will cause immediate docking on reaching the 350m docking limit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Station undock points&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Undocking can be dangerous!  On undocking, you have an invulnerability timer (no more than 30s long) to assess the situation.  If too hazardous, you have the option to redock if you haven&amp;#039;t gone beyond 350m from the structure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, this leads to the big difference between jumping a gate or wormhole and undocking: the initial ship velocity is not zero.  If you make the decision to warp, the time to aligment for warp depends a lot on the direction of the warp.  It is faster than normal if even roughly aligned with the direction of travel and slower if aligned back against the direction of travel.  In the worst case, even ships with fast align times can be vulnerable if warping in the wrong direction.  Conversely, even slowly aligning ships can enter warp quickly if the warp alignment match roughly the direction of travel after undocking.  This is why &amp;quot;insta-undock bookmarks&amp;quot; can be very effective.  See the previous section above for further discussion on insta-undock bookmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some station types can have you undock outside the docking perimeter.  These are called &amp;quot;kick-out stations&amp;quot; and once undocked, you cannot immediately redock -- your ship needs to first travel back inside the docking perimeter.  See [[Common Camp Locations|here]] for a list of station types that are kick-out stations [credit: Asa Kansene, Signal Cartel].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Player Upwell Structures&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the usual dock and undock mechanics of NPC stations, player-operated [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Upwell_structures Upwell structures] have the additional feature of tethering.  Tethering range is 10 km beyond the docking range and so any player that warps to an Upwell structure, &amp;#039;&amp;#039;to which they have docking rights&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, will be automatically tethered.  Similarly, any player undocking will be automatically tethered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tethered ship is immune to attack, even from smartbombs.  This means that it is much more difficult to camp an Upwell structure.  Even bubbling a null-sec or J-space Upwell structure can be circumvented if a line of warp can be established from an unbubbled point within the large tethering radius.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two limitations of tethering should be noted:&lt;br /&gt;
# If a tethered ship is bumped out of tether range, the tether breaks.&lt;br /&gt;
# An upwell structure in abandoned state cannot operate a tether.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Impact of space type===&lt;br /&gt;
Table 6 below gives a summary of important characteristics of different space types when it comes to avoiding and escaping camps.  They determine the options campers have when setting up at a particular gate, wormhole or station.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Table 6: Key characteristics of different space types for camping&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
! &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Space type&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; !! Gate or station security !! Smart bombs !! Warp bubbles&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;High-sec&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; || Unless war-dec&amp;#039;ed, CONCORD&amp;#039;s overwhelming response&lt;br /&gt;
|| Rare || Not allowed&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Low-sec&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; || Gate and station guns, tankable by cruisers and above &lt;br /&gt;
|| Yes || Not allowed&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Null-sec&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; || None || Yes || Allowed&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Pochven&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; || None || Yes || Allowed&lt;br /&gt;
|-&lt;br /&gt;
| &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Wormhole space&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; || None || Yes || Allowed&lt;br /&gt;
|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;high-sec&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, CONCORD will punish any aggressors within a time period determined by the security status of the system.  That punishment is overwhelming and inescapable, leading to destruction of the aggressor ship.  Campers operating in high-sec must expect to lose their ship.  The only exceptions are when there is lawful warfare or combat, typically enabled by war declarations or formal duels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;low-sec&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, there is no CONCORD response, but gate and station guns will retaliate against any aggressor.  The DPS is at a level that frigates and destroyers cannot take for long.  Cruisers and above may be able to tank the damage.  There are also 60s weapons timers preventing combatant ships from jumping through gates or docking until their expiry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Bubbles&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; or other area-of-effect (AOE) warp disruption techniques are not allowed for either high- or low-sec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Smart bombs&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; can be used in low-sec, but are rarely used in high-sec because either they don&amp;#039;t deal enough DPS before CONCORD&amp;#039;s response or, if under a war-dec situation, the danger of inadvertently doing damage to an innocent party and thus drawing CONCORD&amp;#039;s ire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;null-sec&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Pochven&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, or &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;wormhole space&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, there are no restrictions, aside from combat times preventing combatants from jumping through gates or docking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Different types of gate or station camp===&lt;br /&gt;
Table 6 below lists different camp types and examples of the types of ships one might see in each along with the general approaches to avoid or to escape such a camp.  These approaches are discussed in detail in the next section.  Note that the ships listed are the typical ones for the task, however, camps can be set-up by other, perhaps less optimal, choices of ship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In high-sec systems with a high security index of 0.9 or 1.0, there is usually only time to get one shot off before CONCORD responds.  Hence camps usually involve cheap T1 ships with bonuses for autocannons, the weapon type with the &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;highest alpha strike&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; damage, i.e. damage from the first shot: Thrashers for smaller targets and Tornados for larger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where the security index is a bit lower, e.g. 0.5 or 0.6, but still in high-sec, there is more time before CONCORD responds.  Then the approach is usually to use ships with &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;high levels of damage per second&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; at the lowest cost possible -- cheap T1 ships with bonuses for hybrid weapons: Catalysts for smaller targets and Taloses for larger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In low-sec, there is more time for a camp to destroy a ship before the frigates in the camp are forced to retreat due to gate or station guns.  Similarly, since the incoming DPS is typically lower, the target ship&amp;#039;s best response may be to get out or range, jump or warp off.  The focus, therefore, for such camps is to &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;quickly lock&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and disrupt or scramble warp drives, pinning the target on-grid.  Interceptors are used to web or bump any ship attempting to &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; the gate or dock up.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speed of lock becomes critical: a camp with ships that can catch sub-3s or higher align-time ships is usually called a instalocker.  One that can catch sub-2s align-time ships is usually called an ultra-locker.  Such fast lock times are typically achieved with frigates with natively fast locking, improved by sensor boosts from a battlecruiser.  The other surprising option is the Gnosis - it can achieve a low lock time with appropriate fitting and (self) sensor boosts.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d9MCRsbQDE this Dad Dex video] for an excellent decomposition of a typical low-sec gate camp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Smart-bombing&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; camps also become an option in low-sec.  Usually the targets are ships with limited tank such as frigates and shuttles.  Battleships with high CPU are usually the launcher of choice, e.g. Machariels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In null-sec, Pochven and wormhole space, all of the above options are available.  In addition, the use of &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;bubbles&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, i.e. AOE warp disruption, is also allowed.  This allows camps to dispense with fast tackle/insta-locking  as part of the fleet composition and rely on the bubble to hold the ship on grid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===How to escape or avoid a gate or station camp===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of the wide variety of camping strategies, avoiding or escaping a gate, station or wormhole camp requires a variety of approaches, sometime in combination with each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Tanking incoming damage:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
If caught by a high-sec gate-camps, using high-alpha-strike or high-dps ships, lots of passive tank with high resists is usually the best option.  This may involve fitting the ship with what is called a &amp;quot;travel fit&amp;quot; made up of shield extenders with shield hardeners and amplifiers or armor plates with membranes and coatings.  Note that extenders can significantly increase your signature radius, allowing a hunter to lock faster, and armor plates reduce on-grid speed.  Resists (hardeners, amplifiers, membranes and coatings) don&amp;#039;t have these downsides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Active tanking is only effective in more extended engagements in low security space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Avoiding tackle by warping off:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, the best approach on landing in or jumping into a camp is to warp off before the camp can target lock you.  Some approaches include:&lt;br /&gt;
* Fitting for sub-2s align time. (To get to sub-1s align time there are very few options: namely an appropiately fitted Hecate with low-cost implants or a travel-fit Astero with high-cost implants.)  See Table 1 [[Navigating_New_Eden#Propulsion_modules_and_other_relevant_ship_equipment|in the Propulsion module section]] for some options on how to fit for low align time.  Interceptors and the Sunesis can be easily fitted to achieve sub-2s align time.&lt;br /&gt;
* Warp core stabilization.  Another approach is to have as many points of warp core stabilization as the camp has activated on your ship.  Ships like the Venture or the Metamorphosis have +2 of innate warp core stabilization.  Also, one, and no more than one, Warp Core Stabilizer can be fitted using a free low slot, for +2 points of warp core stabilization.  Note that many camping tackle ships fit a faction warp scrambler, with +3 points of warp core disruption, negating any Warp Core Stabilizer.  Warp Core Stablizers can be activated while under the protection of a gate or worm hole cloak.  However, they [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tackling#Warp_core_stabilizers need to be active &amp;#039;&amp;#039;both&amp;#039;&amp;#039; when initiating warp and when entering warp.]&lt;br /&gt;
* MWD-cloak trick.  If your align time is relatively long, say 4s or more, then most camps will lock and disrupt your warp drive.  However, with an appropriately sized microwarpdrive and a cloak, it is possible to achieve warp more quickly.  This involve aligning with the warp-out point, activating the MWD, cloaking and near the end of the MWD cycle, deactivating the cloak and hitting the warp button.  The idea is that while the MWD is operating the ship&amp;#039;s speed will be in excess of 75% of the on-grid speed without the MWD -- which is the required speed for entering warp when the MWD cycle ends.&lt;br /&gt;
* Burst jammers.  These need to be activated prior to entering warp -- they have a certain probability of breaking the target lock of any the camping ships.  Note that since these may impact other ships not in the camp, their use can be considered as an act of aggression in low- or high-sec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Crashing the gate or wormhole:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
If you unable to escape target lock, often the best option is to &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; the gate or wormhole.  If you have an MWD, ensure that it is activated at least once before being locked and potentially warp scrambled, shutting down the MWD. Afterburners don&amp;#039;t suffer the same fate as MWDs, but the ship can be webbed down, greatly reducing speed, and increasing time to the gate or wormhole. Using an oversized afterburner, e.g. 10MN instead of 1MN, can mitigate webs, but ensure that the ship is already heading in the right direction before activating since align time greatly increases with an active oversized afterburner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Avoiding AOE bubbles or smart-bombs:&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
Specialized approaches are needed to counter bubbles and smart-bombs:&lt;br /&gt;
* Never warp directly from one gate to another -- this is the approach angle expected and used for positioning a bubble or a smart bomber. By first warping to another celestial (not near another gate!), the second warp to the gate can be at a different approach angle, probably separated enough to avoid smart bomb damage and possibly even a warp bubble.&lt;br /&gt;
* Nullification (bubbles only).  A limited number of ship classes (e.g. Covert Ops) can fit and use a Nullifier module.  If activated prior to &amp;#039;&amp;#039;initiating&amp;#039;&amp;#039; warp, this module will nullify the effect of any warp bubble in the path of the warp.  Note that Nullifiers have long cool-down times (100 to 150s) and this must be managed when flying through several systems.&lt;br /&gt;
* Cloak and slow-boat.  If a cloak is fitted, one can break the gate cloak and immediately cloak up and attempt to fly out of the area of effect of a bubble at sub-warp speed.  However, many gate campers will have scattered objects (e.g. jettisoned containers, drones, fighters), to de-cloak such ships.  Some camps will also have fast frigates to try to intercept and de-cloak ships that will have momentarily appeared on overview  between the gate cloak and the conventional cloak.&lt;br /&gt;
* Tanking (smart-bombs only).  Even large smart bombs will have relatively limited damage.  A well tanked frigate or destroyer can withstand one or two hits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Template:ExplorersHandbook}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==The grid==&lt;br /&gt;
Each time a ship comes out of warp, a grid is loaded.  It is typically a space 16,000 km across, centered on a celestial, structure, site, or bookmark.  The grid size can vary, with locations such as Jita 4-4 having a larger grid than normal or others such as abyssal deadspace having a much smaller grid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player can fly their ship in any direction on the grid and can see and inspect visually objects such as their ship, other ships, celestials, structures, etc. that are physically located on the grid.  The player&amp;#039;s overview can also show &amp;#039;&amp;#039;all&amp;#039;&amp;#039; uncloaked objects that are on the grid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Movement on the grid is not based on classical Newtonian mechanics in a vacuum, but instead behaves more like an object moving through a fluid.  For example, throttling up afterburners does not result in steady acceleration to arbitrarily large speeds -- instead a given ship has a maximum velocity.  Similarly, throttling down an afterburner results in a gradual loss of speed, more consistent with motion through some gaseous or liquid medium.  Motion on grid in EVE Online has been likened to that of a submarine in water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Propulsion modules and other relevant ship equipment==&lt;br /&gt;
(See also [[Exploration_Ship_Fitting_Guide#General_Principles|the Explorer&amp;#039;s Guide section on fitting]] for the general principles of fitting ships.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A ship can move on grid much more quickly through the use of propulsion engines, jump drives or warp drives. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Maximum speed&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Propulsion drives are available on all ships, but their maximum speed can be greatly enhanced by either of the following two active, mid-power ship modules, know colloquially as &amp;quot;prop mods&amp;quot;: (a) Afterburners (ABs) and (b) Microwarpdrives (MWDs).  See Table 1 below for a brief summary of their properties and those of passive, low-power modules that also enhance speed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are two other alternative mechanisms to travel even faster:&lt;br /&gt;
# Use the in-build warp drive between two points at least 150km apart.  Note that the in-built warp drive can only be used on objects that can be warped to (see the section on in-system navigation).&lt;br /&gt;
# For battlecruisers, battleships and their size equivalents, use a Micro Jump Drive (MJDs) to jump forward 100km in the direction of travel after a short (~10s) spool-up.  MJDs also have longer cool-down times (up to 3 &amp;#039;&amp;#039;minutes&amp;#039;&amp;#039;).  Additionally, Micro Jump Field Generators are MJDs that also jump up to 25 ships within a radius of 6km.  Used only on Command Destroyers, this is referred to as &amp;quot;booshing&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a few other modules that negatively impact a ship&amp;#039;s navigation and maneuverability, with highly specialized uses - see Table 2 below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Agility&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Agility is a second critical parameter for a ship&amp;#039;s maneuverability.  It measured as the time it takes a ship to align to the desired direction with 75% of maximum speed from a standing start.  It also is how long it takes a ship to get into warp after initiating warp.  Modules that help to improve agility are the Inertial Stabilizer and Nanofiber Internal Structure.  Two rig types also help: Low Friction Nozzle Joints and Polycarbon Engine Housings.&lt;br /&gt;

==Improving your character&amp;#039;s abilities==&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Skills&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the relevant skills for directly improving maximum velocity and agility are under the &amp;quot;Navigation&amp;quot; tab in the skills catalogue.  This tab also has a number of skills for improving the ability to use afterburners and MWDs.  One often-overlooked skill that impacts agility is that of Spaceship Command under the &amp;quot;Spaceship Command&amp;quot; tab: it improves your agility by 2% for every level of skill trained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See also [[Skills_and_Implants#Navigation_Skills|the Explorer&amp;#039;s Handbook section on Skills and Implants]] for further discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Implants&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Much of the information here is taken from [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Implants the Eve University Wiki].&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A number of implants improve agility and maximum speed:&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Eifyr &amp;amp; Co. &amp;#039;Rogue&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; skill hardwirings boost the same characteristics as given in the &amp;quot;Navigation&amp;quot; tab of the skills catalogue.  So, for example, the &amp;quot;Eifyr and Co. &amp;#039;Rogue&amp;#039; Evasive Maneuvering EM-703&amp;quot; implant improves ship agility by 3%.&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Genolution Core Augmentation CA-3&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; implant provides a 1.5% improvement in maximum speed with a further 0.45% improvement if a clone has a full set of Genolution implants.&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Genolution Core Augmentation CA-4&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; implant provides a 1.5% improvement in agility with a further 0.3% improvement if a clone has a full set of Genolution implants.&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Snake attribute enhancer implants&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; have improved maximum speed as their secondary effect.  For example, a complete set of 6 mid-grade Snake implants will give just over 16% improvement to maximum speed.&lt;br /&gt;
* The &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Nomad attribute enhancer implants&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; have improved agility as their secondary effect.  For example, a complete set of 6 mid-grade Nomad implants will give just over 27% improvement to agility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Medical Boosters&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following boosters impact either maximum velocity or agility:&lt;br /&gt;

Note that Drop, Frentix, Sooth Sayer, and Crash boosters can have reductions in maximum speed as their possible negative side effect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Automated movement==&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;quot;You&amp;#039;re not flying a fighter. You&amp;#039;re commanding a vessel.&amp;quot;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/151dmfo/is_the_player_able_to/ BlodhgarmDethahal on Reddit]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For much of the time, navigation on-grid involves using one of four commands that result in an automated response by your ship: &lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Aligning&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; leads to your ship flying in the direction of a selected object, often off-grid.  This is often used to prepare a ship for warp, since the first step in any warp is to align and come to at least 75% of maximum speed.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Approaching&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is the simplest of commands, directing your ship to head directly for the selected object and only stopping when reaching it.  This often leads to your ship bouncing off the approached object.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Orbiting&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is frequently used in PVE, setting the ship up in an orbit around the selected object at a distance either manually selected or (if pressing the orbit button) at the default distance.  This maneuver is useful for ensuring that you control your range to the target, while maintaining a good transversal, mitigating damage from turret weapons, and velocity, mitigating damage from missiles.  Some important subtleties: &lt;br /&gt;
** It should be noted that the command results in a orbit choice that is random in its inclination and orientation.  The ship will first approach the point in the orbit closest to itself and if the player is unlucky, that approach angle may have poor transversal, leading to large damage application from the target object.&lt;br /&gt;
** If a prop mod is active then the orbit achieved will have greater radius than commanded.  The extra distance from the selected object is relatively small for afterburners, but significant for MWDs.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Keeping at range&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is where the ship is commanded to head directly towards the selected object, but advance no closer than the selected range.  This command is often used in PVP, especially against ships of equal size or smaller, to control the range to the target ship.  The control algorithm is underdamped, i.e. there is a strong tendency to overshoot the target range, particularly if an MWD is active.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Manual maneuvering and advanced techniques==&lt;br /&gt;
There are times when the automated maneuvers simply do not achieve the result that you are looking for.  There are two manual flying techniques that can be used for either more directed flying or more sophisticated maneuvers:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;quot;Clicking in space&amp;quot;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is used to aim your ship in the direction of your choice.  Rotate your view until you are very roughly behind your spacecraft relative to the desired direction.  Then double-click in space for the direction you want to move in.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Holding down the &amp;quot;Q&amp;quot; button&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is to set a point on the grid for the ship to move directly to.  Holding down the Q button will position a small light blue circular marker in the horizontal plane around your ship.  A line will join that marker to your ship to indicate the direction the ship will travel in.  Control the position of the circular marker with your mouse until it is in the desired location.  Having the tactical grid view switched on helps greatly with this. At this stage there are two options:&lt;br /&gt;
# Double-click the left mouse button to fix the position of the circle marker in the horizontal plan and the ship will commence movement towards that marker.&lt;br /&gt;
# Single left-click to fix the horizontal direction and the distance to be traveled out from the ship; move the mouse up or down to set the angle made in the vertical direction; and finally left click-again to set the circle marker in position.  Again the ship will commence movement toward the marker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Building on these manual controls, a good pilot can then execute the following two advanced maneuvers:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;quot;Spiraling in&amp;quot;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; refers to a maneuver to limit the damage received from turreted weapons as the player attempts to establish a close orbit around a (typically bigger) ship:&lt;br /&gt;
# The player selects a direction (using either of the two manual piloting techniques above) that is not directly towards the target spacecraft, but off to one side, at an angle.  &lt;br /&gt;
# As the player&amp;#039;s ship gets closer, the angle opens out again and the player reselects the direction to close the angle again.  The resulting motion is a spiral in towards the target.  &lt;br /&gt;
# When close to the desired final distance, the player will often select &amp;quot;orbit at&amp;quot; to move into the final, settled orbit around the target.&lt;br /&gt;
See [https://youtu.be/1aRAp7q1oIg?t=317 this video] for an example of the technique.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* A &amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;quot;sling-shot&amp;quot;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; refers to a maneuver to close range with a faster target that is kiting you, i.e. keeping a certain range, outside that of your weapon systems:&lt;br /&gt;
# Burn away from the target.&lt;br /&gt;
# As the target begins to move towards you and builds up some speed, head back towards the target.  If the target was orbiting you, aim towards where you expect the target ship to be few seconds from now rather than approaching it directly.&lt;br /&gt;
# The target ship may take time to readjust and reverse course away from you.  This gives you time to close the gap with the target and get within web, scram and weapons range.&lt;br /&gt;
See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKOnPvFVA4c this video] for a good tutorial on the technique.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Objects on-grid==&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Bounding boxes&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most objects on the grid will have defined bounding boxes that are close to the actual shape of the object.  Until the object is destroyed, it is not possible to fly through them and your ship will bounce off them, killing your speed.  This can be catastrophic for your ship if you are speed-tanking incoming damage or attempting to reach 75% of maximum speed to enter warp.  Wrecks and small debris in asteroid fields don&amp;#039;t have bounding boxes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Force fields&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Force fields in EVE Online are semi-translucent spheres in place around certain stationary objects.  Two examples:&lt;br /&gt;
* A player owned structure (POS) can support a force field to prevent entry by outside ships and to protect assets inside from attack.&lt;br /&gt;
* Cans in Sleeper Caches can have force fields that can be deactivated by successfully hacking a Remote Defense Grid Unit. Alternatively, a fast exploration or covert ops frigate can reach the protected can before the force field goes up, after being triggered by the approaching frigate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Gas clouds&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gas clouds don&amp;#039;t impede motion, but can be either harvestable or cause periodic damage.  To see the extent of gas clouds requires the EVE client to be running on reasonably capable graphics hardware -- the boundaries of gas clouds are not shown in &amp;quot;Performance Optimized&amp;quot; mode.&lt;br /&gt;
