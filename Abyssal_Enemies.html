<p>Due to the Cynabals' good damage, webs, and great tracking and projection, Angel rooms are notoriously difficult for frigates. The Cynabal neuts also severely pressure many cruisers' capacitors, especially if only running a single battery. However, the danger of this room is concentrated in a handful of enemies, and once the Cynabals are off the field, it becomes pretty easy. Angel rooms can also be tricky for drone ships, since many enemies have webs and will switch to drones en masse. However, if they're shooting your drones, at least they're not shooting you for a bit.

<p>Clear Cynabals first, followed by Elite Cynabals, unless there's some other immediate threat. Lucifer Echos deal a lot of damage for how flimsy they are, so it can make sense to clear one first to reduce pressure on your tank before starting on the Cynabals. Lucifer Bursts do remote shield rep the other rats, but the reps aren't all that strong.

<p>Another relatively recent addition, this room contains enemies that exclusively do missile-style damage through actual missiles (CONCORD) and Vorton Projectors (EDENCOM). This means that transversal is irrelevant, but having a small signature and maintaining high speed is essential. The rats do a lot of alpha damage but fire slowly, so losing speed or entering a blue cloud at the wrong moment can be deadly.

<p>CONCORD rats have uniform resists and fire missiles. EDENCOM rats have lowest thermal resist and fire chain lightning, which bounces to nearby enemy or friendly targets indiscriminately. Battleships start off damaged. All rats are clearly named in accordance with their singular role. Damage types appear to be random. No remote repair.

<p>In most cases, this is an extremely high-damage room. All enemies will apply at least some of their damage, and support ships will usually deal most or all of their full damage. The webbing and painting ships will massively increase incoming damage, and stumbling into a blue cloud can spell death. Drones can also quickly die if in range of the chain lightning.

<p>EWAR Pacifiers are fragile and enable the bigger ships to do far more damage. Clear them quickly. The battleships have around a 65km range, so turning around and outranging them at the beginning of a room is a good way to safely clear smaller ships. Battleships spawn damaged, so clear them as quickly as practicable.

<p>This room's similar to Angels, but usually easier. Enemies will solely deal EM and thermal damage through lasers. Most of the damage comes from the cruisers, which have poor tracking and are slow with no webs, but have good range and strong shield tanks. They also have heavy neuting up close. Unlike with Angels, there are no "Elite" variants. There's only 1 cruiser-type enemy.

<p>While they're slow and have bad tracking, Devoted Knights still deal a lot of damage. Additionally, Devoted Hunters do a surprising amount of damage for their size. Rampant disruption can make things difficult for missile and turret ships, especially if there are Devoted Priests. Devoted Smiths neut a lot.

<p>Hunters and Smiths are fragile targets and can be destroyed quickly to reduce tank or neut pressure. All other frigates are similarly thin. The only tanky targets are the cruisers, and those can easily be kited due to their bad tracking and lack of long-range webs.

<p>One of the most common enemies to face in the abyss, Drifters and their suborned Ephialtes and Sleeper drones are characterized by having a decent amount of EHP on a large number of reasonably fast-moving targets, with many, many possible combinations of the 3 types of enemies. These rooms aren't a threat to most tanks outside of Karybdis Tyrannos, but feature lots of EWAR that can lean heavily in one direction and lots of EHP to chew through. Sleepers all have remote armor reps; Ephialtes and Drifters do not. Sleepers are armor-tanked without shields, while Drifters and Ephialtes are shield-tanked. Drifters spawn damaged and regenerate over time. Needless to say, Drifters and Sleepers in the abyss are far less dangerous than their non-abyss variants.

<p>Far less dangerous than non-abyss Drifters, these enemies nevertheless pose a threat, especially in Karybdis Tyrannos (Drifter battleship) rooms. The battleship does a lot of damage with enough range to cover nearly the entire room, and attempts to quickly pull range into a 65km orbit. If it gets near a tracking pylon, or spawns in a room with a lot of blue clouds, or has a lot of webbing and painting support, its damage can quickly become deadly. Maintaining high transversal is absolutely critical in Karybdis rooms.
</p><p>Drifter cruisers, on the other hand, make for convenient targets due to their large size and close orbit range. They deal moderate but not extreme damage. Just be wary of Entanglement cruisers targeting your drones.
</p><p>All Drifters spawn damaged and will repair themselves over time. They're primarily shield tanked.
</p><p>Fun fact: Karybdis Tyrannos is one of the only 2 abyssal enemies to have a unique variant with different stats in every tier, the other being the rogue drone Overmind battleship.

<p>Based on the Circadian Seekers and Autothysian Lancers of k-space, Ephialtes drones don't deal much damage, but are fast with small signatures for cruisers and spawn in large numbers. Ephialtes rooms are an application check: if your weapons or drones don't apply well to small and fast targets, you could time out. Due to the large numbers they spawn in, Ephialtes also tend to lean heavily towards one or two forms of EWAR, creating heavy pressure on some fits. They're a good example of why having any glaring weakness in a fit can be deadly in high tiers.
</p><p>Ephialtes have flat 10% resists, making them a great opportunity to use a bonused damage type rather than a weather-friendly one (e.g., kinetic on a Cerberus or Gila, and Augmented drones rather than navy ones). Some of them will also switch to attacking drones and can burn them down surprisingly quickly.

<p>Sleepers are all armor tanked with no shield layer at all, and all have some form of remote armor repair similar to Triglavians, though Lucid Preservers have a stronger version. Abyssal sleepers are considerably weaker than their wormhole and Pochven variants, and don't pose a DPS threat to most ships. They also don't have much EHP aside from Lucid Deepwatchers. However, their EWAR, especially neuts, can pressure fits if unchecked. Sleepers deal primarily EM/thermal damage, with some additional kinetic/explosive missile damage. They have decently high omni-resists, meaning that weather resist penalty takes priority.
</p><p>Sleepers will partially switch to attack drones. This can be annoying due to Upholder and Warden webs. Sleepers do a surprising amount of damage to drones due to their EM/thermal damage preference.
</p><p>Webs (Wardens and Upholders) are high priority in Karybdis rooms, as they do not-good things to your speed, which allows Karybdis to do not-good things to your <s>ship</s> pod.

<p>This room has a lot of different variations featuring different combinations of Drifters, Ephialtes, and Sleeper cruisers and frigates. No battleships are present here. Nothing in this room type deals significant damage, but the room does tend to have a lot of EWAR and a lot of EHP to get through. For that reason, it's important to prioritize the biggest EWAR threats to your fit (probably neuts, followed by webs in a drone ship and disruption in a turret/missile ship). It's also important to always be shooting something. In the absence of EWAR threats, Drifters and Sleepers should be prioritized over Ephialtes, as Drifters start off damaged and Sleepers have remote reps. Drifter cruisers make for good targets, as they're big and tend to follow you around closely. Ephialtes have flat 10% resists, making them a good opportunity to use a bonused damage type that doesn't match the weather penalty.
</p><p>Some of the room will switch to shooting your drones, which can be difficult to deal with if there are a lot of webbing ships.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Karybdis_Tyrannos">Karybdis Tyrannos</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="https://wiki.signalcartel.space/index.php?title=Abyssal_Enemies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Karybdis Tyrannos">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>One of the "boss rooms" of the abyss, this room features a main Drifter battleship (Karybdis Tyrannos, aka "Karen") with supporting Drifter, Ephialtes, and/or Sleeper EWAR cruisers. Karen's tracking is mediocre, but it has enough range to cover nearly the entire room, and can deal very dangerous wrecking shots. The battleship will try to burn away from the player into a 65km orbit, which often brings it to the very edge of the boundary. If there are Ephialtes Lancers, the battleship might follow one of them around instead, which will bring it very close to the player.
</p><p>In this room, it's important to prioritize EWAR threats correctly. Start by clearing as many neuts as you need for your fit to handle the rest (you'll learn this threshold with practice). Then focus on webs, followed by paints. Webs and paints will make it far easier for Karen to damage you. Getting into a close orbit on Karen can mitigate most or all of its damage, but that's not always feasible unless you spawn in a white cloud.
</p><p>Make sure to stay out of blue clouds, and keep Karen away from tracking pylons. Either one could easily be deadly for you.

<p>This room's boring. It isn't dangerous to most fits damage-wise, but has a lot of EHP to clear and is a DPS check for fits. The room features a number of slow Lucid Deepwatcher battleships with possible support ships. Tiers 1 and 2 have a single battleship, Tiers 3 and 4 have 2, T5 has 3, and T6 has 4. Occasionally, 1 fewer battleship will spawn than normal, but there will be more support ships to compensate. Sleeper support ships will remote repair the battleships, so it's important to clear them first. Ephialtes support ships can usually be ignored, as they don't have remote reps and the battleships will repair each other. The battleships start off damaged.
</p><p>Deepwatchers have terrible tracking, but can deal a surprising amount of damage if you sit still and they start chaining shots. They also fire extremely slow missiles with very long flight times. It's usually more than enough to just orbit the gate. It's critical to always be shooting something in this room to avoid timer problems. This room's a great place to overheat your weapons.

<p>One of the most common enemy types in the abyss, rogue drones are found in both their own rooms and in Triglavian rooms as support craft. Specifically, rogue drone frigates (Tessellas) will act as support for Triglavian spawns, but rogue drone battlecruisers and battleships are restricted to their own special rooms. Overmind battleships are one of the "boss" spawns in the abyss, and are one of the 2 enemies with a unique variant with different stats in each tier (the other being Karybdis Tyrannos). In tiers 1 through 4, the Overmind has no EWAR. In 5 and 6, it has a 15km web.
</p><p>Rogue drone frigates and Overminds have varied resist profiles, while battlecruisers have lowest EM and explosive resists, similar to Gallente T2 hulls. Just do the weather resist penalty damage type.

<p>Tessellas are very weak, extremely flimsy rogue drone frigates that can appear in their own (easy) room, along with acting as support in other rogue drone and Triglavian rooms. The only somewhat dangerous Tessellas are the EWAR variants, as they make dealing with larger and more dangerous enemies more difficult. "Lance" Tessellas deal more damage at greater range than "Needle" ones. While individual Tessellas are weak, they can deal a surprising amount of damage if a lot of them get on top of you, especially if they're shooting into your resist hole. Fortunately, Tessellas are flimsy and easily taken out by a Deviant Automata Suppressor, and will sometimes stop moving if one of them dies. If the drones spawn next to a short-range suppressor, the room might even be over by the time you start moving!
</p><p>All Tessellas have standard T1 resist profiles, with low EM and high explosive shield resists, and high EM and low explosive armor resists. However, they're all so flimsy that damage type is pretty much irrelevant against them. Logi Tessellas (Fieldweaver and Plateforger) have no resists at all.

<p>Rogue drone battlecruisers are designed differently from all other enemies in the abyss, in that they have 4000 (effectively unlimited) tracking and deal ludicrous damage, but only within a short range (2km optimal + 6km falloff). They also have bad agility, but high speed (the fastest version, Blastgrip, goes 900 m/s). It's critical to keep moving and keep your distance in this room (at least 11km if possible). If Tesseras do manage to land shots, frigates will die almost instantly and most cruisers will turn to paste soon after.
</p><p>These battlecruisers often spawn with support frigates, specifically Snarecasters (webs). Clear these first to avoid getting tied down and shredded.
</p><p>Tesseras are a prime example of why having any resist hole is a bad idea in the abyss. If numerous Tesseras of one damage type spawn, it can be fatal if that damage is the one you have a hole for.
</p><p>Tesseras have a unique form of drone aggro. Only a single Tessera will ever attack player drones at a given time, and that Tessera won't change until it's destroyed. If a Tessera starts shooting your drones and you recall them, that same Tessera will switch back to shooting your drones when you relaunch them. If flying a drone ship, always prioritize the Tessera shooting your drones if there aren't Snarecaster frigates left on grid. Even a single Tessera will still shred drones, so recall the one being shot the moment it starts taking damage.

<p>The Overmind, also known as the baked potato. It's a rogue drone battleship that spawns with rogue drone frigates for support. The Overmind is fairly slow and has bad tracking, but can project damage out to a decent range, and can do a lot of damage if it does land hits. It deals kinetic and thermal damage, and has its lowest resists in thermal, followed by kinetic. Orbiting the Overmind up close is a good way to mitigate damage, but this is difficult at tiers 5 and 6 due to the web it gets at those tiers.
</p><p>The Overmind is primarily armor tanked, and usually the slowest room to complete due to how much EHP it has. The Overmind's large size and low speed makes it a good candidate for overheating weapons.
</p><p>Before starting on the Overmind, it's important to clear certain support frigates. Snarecaster (web) and Spotlighter (paint) Tessellas will help the Overmind apply damage. It's critical to clear Fieldweaver (shield logi) and Plateforger (armor logi) Tessellas before hitting the Overmind, as their reps will make it even tankier than it already is. Like the Lucid Deepwatchers, the Overmind's a DPS check that serves to test whether your fit's doing sufficient damage for its tier.
</p><p>As with Karybdis Tyrannos, stay out of blue clouds and keep the Overmind away from tracking pylons. Deviant Automata Suppressors are helpful to clear support rogue drone frigates faster.
</p><p>Recall drones when you see the Overmind go from redboxing to yellowboxing you: that means it's switching to shooting your drones. Between the high damage and the web in T5 and T6, an Overmind can easily destroy drones in just a few hits.

<p>Triglavians are the most common enemies you'll face in the abyss, with the most spawn variety. It is their space, after all.
</p><p>All Triglavian ships are armor tanked and have remote armor reps, with some specialized variants like Renewing Leshaks and Renewing Rodivas having significantly stronger ones. All Triglavian ships exclusively deal thermal followed by explosive damage due to their Entropic Disintegrator weapon system. This weapon system is unique: Triglavian ships will start out dealing relatively low damage, and their damage will increase as they continue firing at the same target until eventually reaching 250% of its base value. Misses will not reset the damage ramp, but leaving weapon range or causing a target switch will. Triglavians don't have a falloff range, just an optimal. Within this optimal, they have excellent tracking for their size. Triglavians are the reason why having a thermal hole is very bad in the abyss (this is what holds the Sacrilege back at high tiers, along with its damage being split between missiles and unbonused drones).
</p><p>In one specific room, unique Vila variants of Damaviks and Vedmaks will spawn. These have weaker primary weapons than normal, but launch Vila Swarmer drones that deal consistent omni damage and can take down player drones surprisingly quickly if they start attacking them. Destroying the host ship will immediately disconnect all launcher Vila drones, so don't bother targeting the Vilas themselves. This doesn't apply to actual rogue drone frigates.
</p><p>Triglavians are inherently weakest against explosive damage, but their resists are high enough that weather penalty takes priority. Triglavians will sometimes spawn with rogue drone Tessella frigates as support.
</p><p>Many Triglavian ships will anchor on the ship they're remote repping. You can exploit this by outranging the anchor to reset the Triglavian damage ramp.

<p>Damaviks can be found in every Triglavian room aside from Leshaks, and often spawn alongside rogue drone frigates. Damaviks don't deal much damage on their own, but can be tricky to deal with in conjunction with larger ships due to having a lot of different EWAR. A lot of weapon and guidance disrupting Damaviks can also be tricky for turret and missile ships, as Damaviks are small targets and remote repair each other. Outranging a Damavik will cause it to activate its MWD to burn back to you, which will increase application against it.
</p><p>Due to how thin they are, it's often worthwhile to clear one Damavik with annoying EWAR at the very start of a room before engaging more threatening targets.

<p>These are Triglavian battlecruisers with good range and high damage, but relatively poor tracking (they are battlecruisers, after all). They spawn damaged, but have amazing remote repairs (half as powerful as Renewing Leshaks and Rodivas- the strongest RR enemies in the abyss- and equivalent to Leshaks), especially considering they're not a specialized logistics spawn. Drekavacs tend to spawn with Kikimoras and Damaviks as support, which throws a lot of EWAR into the mix and can confuse inexperienced pilots. Drekavacs will not spawn alongside Vedmaks or Leshaks.
</p><p>It's vital to eliminate Drekavacs as quickly as possible, unless targeting them will get you killed. Their remote reps will make taking down other targets take a very long time. The one exception to this is destroying one EWAR Damavik at the start of the room, but even then, just switch to a Drekavac if they start landing reps on the Damavik before you destroy it.

<p>These are Triglavian destroyers. Similar to Damaviks, Kikimoras have several EWAR variants and have a high MWD speed and low orbit speed. However, they deal significantly more damage with stronger remote reps. They can project damage out to 25km with excellent tracking. Notably, Kikimoras will never neut.
</p><p>Kikimoras can spawn in rooms with Damaviks, Drekavacs, and Rodivas. They can also appear on their own. They will not spawn alongside Vedmaks or Leshaks.
</p><p>If Kikimoras are the largest targets in a room, prioritizing them is almost always the right call. If a lot of Kikimoras get full ramp on you, your tank can easily break. As usual, clearing an EWAR Damavik before starting the room proper can be a good idea.

<p>Like Tesseras, Leshak rooms are designed counterintuitively to what you might expect from battleships in the abyss. For starters, Leshaks might be battleships, but they spawn so badly damaged that they can each be cleared in seconds once you start applying damage. The problem is actually starting to apply damage to them. Similar to other Triglavians, Leshaks have MWDs. But instead of trying to chase you like other Triglavians, Leshaks will use their MWDs to starburst and try to burn away from you as fast as possible in different directions while remote repairing each other and shooting you. This doesn't apply to Starving and Tangling variants, which will try to follow you around.
</p><p>Speaking of remote repairs, Leshaks have the strongest remote reps in the abyss, with Renewing Leshaks repping the same amount as Rodivas and twice as much as Drekavacs, and all other Leshaks repairing just as much as Drekavacs. Left unchecked, a room of Leshaks will rep each other up quickly and massively increase clear time.
</p><p>This makes Leshak rooms a test of damage projection, mobility, and using the environment. Player ships need to have the range to hit Leshaks and the mobility to get between distant groups of them. White clouds are very helpful for this, and can make a Leshak room among the fastest clears in the abyss. On the flip side, flying a slow close-range ship without white clouds can make a Leshak room extremely long and a real timeout threat. Leshak rooms are a good example of why blaster ships like the Deimos aren't good in high tiers.
</p><p>On top of the starbursting and remote reps, Leshak rooms have the strongest neuting in the abyss via Starving Leshaks. Just a few of these can zap a HAC's capacitor dry in just a handful of cycles. Blinding Leshaks also have strong sensor damps, and will massively reduce your lock range while burning away from you. Tangling Leshaks are the easiest Leshaks to deal with, as their webs only reach 12km and they'll follow you around instead of burning away from you.
</p><p>Target priority in a Leshak room is usually Renewing, then Starving, then Blinding, then everything else. The exception to this is when there are a lot of Starvings (shoot them until your cap's under control), or when you're in a drone ship (tell the drones to engage a Blinding before you lose lock due to the damps). Drone ships are the best suited to Leshak rooms due to drone auto-attack.
</p><p>Leshaks often spawn with rogue drone support frigates, but will never spawn alongside any other Triglavian ships.

<p>While every Triglavian ship has some form of remote armor reps, these are dedicated remote repair cruisers. Interestingly, they still have (weak) entropic disintegrators for damage, whereas player Rodivas and Zarmazds can't even fit them. Rodiva remote reps are the strongest in the abyss, equivalent only to those of Renewing Leshaks, the other dedicated Triglavian remote repair ship.
</p><p>Rodivas will only spawn alongside Damaviks, Kikimoras, and rogue drone frigates. These spawns will have fewer enemies and are easier than ones without Rodivas. The Rodiva + Tessella spawn is probably the easiest room in the abyss.
</p><p>The best target to prioritize in a Rodiva room is almost always the Rodivas due to how tanky they make every other enemy. Rodivas are pretty fast and decently big, and like to close range, so are easy to apply damage against. They also aren't all that tanky themselves.

<p>Vedmak rooms can be deceptively tricky in high tiers, and may also feature Damaviks and Tessellas. Vedmak rooms won't have any other additional enemy types. Vedmaks combine high damage, high projection, good application, strong neuts, remote repair, and good tanks in a very mobile package, and often spawn alongside EWAR Triglavian and rogue drone frigates. Their ramp also makes their damage output even nastier.
</p><p>The right targets to prioritize in Vedmak rooms are almost always Starving Vedmaks. While clearing one EWAR Damavik at the start of a room is usually a good idea, it can be deadly in high-tier Vedmak rooms. It's difficult to reset Vedmak ramp due to their MWDs, but white clouds still make it very possible.

<p>Triglavian "Vila" ships are unique in that they launch drones to supplement their primary weapons. These "Vila Swarmer" drones deal low but consistent omni-damage. In exchange, the ships themselves are less dangerous than their regular counterparts. Vila Vedmaks deal only half the damage of their regular counterparts, while Vila Damaviks do a quarter. However, Vila Swarmers can make quick work of player drones, especially if there are webs on grid.
</p><p>Vila drones themselves aren't ever worth targeting, as they all disconnect when their host ship is destroyed. However, Vila Swarmers are flimsy, and fighting near a Short-Range Deviant Automata Suppressor can destroy Vila drones faster than they're replenished.
</p><p>Vila Vedmaks and Vila Damaviks will only spawn alongside other Vila Vedmaks and Vila Damaviks, but may have additional rogue drone frigate support. Every Vila ship has a regular counterpart except the Blinding Vila Damavik, which is the only Damavik type that uses sensor damps, and the Shining Vila Damavik, which is the only Damavik that uses target painters. There is no Starving Vila Damavik. In fact, no Vila ships will ever neut, as there's no Starving Vila Vedmak either.
