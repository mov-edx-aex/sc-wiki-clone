Nevertheless, '''ALL''' members of Signal Cartel (SC) are expected to be knowledgeable regarding its contents. If there are any questions regarding [[Directory_of_Important_Information_(DII)#.F0.9F.94.A5_Corp_Policies_.F0.9F.94.A5|SC policies]], please reach out to a member of the Leadership Team.

 '''NOTE:'''  Please pay particular attention to the "Code of Conduct" and "Kickable Offenses" sections.
=== EvE-Scout Enclave Leadership Team ===
* [[User:Katia_Sae|Katia Sae]] (EvE-Scout Enclave Alliance Executor, EvE-Scout CEO, Signal Cartel Director, Discord/Website Admin, Alliance Diplo)
* Aldar Roanaok (Signal Cartel CEO, Alliance Diplo)

Katia and Aldar work together to make policy decisions and oversee operations. Feel free to contact them with questions or concerns.  They can be flagged down on [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|Discord]] or in-game.

=== Code of Conduct ===
In addition to the '''[[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]]''', we have a family-friendly rule, both in both language and topic, for all in- and out-of-game communications channels/platforms. This extends to character biographies, character names, and includes any linked content. Many of our members have children or early teens who may be watching or listening to them play. We therefore do not tolerate toxic, vulgar, hateful, mean-spirited, or foul-natured conduct or language.  We do not tolerate drama or rabble-rousing. The one thing we hear most often from departing or returning members is that ‚Äúthis is the nicest corp and group of people I‚Äôve ever met in a game‚Äù and that is exactly how we aim to keep it. 

Furthermore, Signal Cartel members recognize the dignity and worth of every person in New Eden. Our aim is to create a climate of understanding and mutual respect so that each person feels a part of and is able to contribute to our community. To that end, discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to age, sex, gender, sexual identity, nationality, or ethnicity, is not tolerated.

Lastly, please avoid real life (RL) politics, religion, and other controversial RL topics in all our communication channels/platforms. Members are here to play a game, enjoy each other's company, escape RL for a bit, and have fun. Conversations should primarily be related to the game and associated events and meta activities.

Observed or reported conduct violations are reviewed by Leadership.  Generally, Signal Cartel has a Two Strikes and Out policy as listed immediately below.  

=== Kickable Offenses ===

* Signal Cartel has a '''Two Strikes and Out''' policy.  Strikes are imposed at Leadership's discretion, typically 1 per violation or compliance failure. If a member receives 2 strikes, they will be removed from the corp. If removed for strikes, the player will be banned. This is done to help preserve the corp culture and to honor and serve the interests of members who do comply with both [[Policy:The_Credo | the Credo]] and [[Directory_of_Important_Information_(DII)#.F0.9F.94.A5_Corp_Policies_.F0.9F.94.A5|corp policy]].  
** Credo and policy violations
** Failing to [[Policy:Reporting_Kills_and_CONCORD_Losses | report Kills and CONCORD losses]] to the CEO '''within 48 hours''' of their occurrence
** Failing to respond to official inquiries or policy-compliance requests as directed
** Refusing/failing to make restitution as demanded by Leadership to other capsuleers that have been wronged  
* Performing any activity specifically prohibited by [[Policy:The_Credo|the Credo]] (such as podding a capsuleer or placing bounties, among others).
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon#Awox AWOXing] a corp member.
* Theft from any alliance member or the corp.
* Other conduct determined by Leadership to be a poor fit for our culture, for example willfully ignoring our Code of Conduct policy with offensive language or topics -- especially after being warned by Leadership or other members about such conduct.
* Failing to complete required tasks identified in the Welcome Letter automatically sent to each new member upon joining.
* Inactivity (see [[Policy:Corp_Admin_Info_and_Policies#Activity_Requirements | Activity Requirements]], below).

If a member is kicked for a Credo violation, they will receive an EVEmail explaining why. If a member is kicked for another kickable offense (mostly inactivity or failure to perform required tasks as listed in the Welcome Letter), they are unlikely to receive an EVEmail stating why (but feel free to inquire). As stated above, being kicked for Credo violations results in a permanent ban from rejoining.

There are a number of corp policies that help to clarify Credo and other conduct questions. Members can find them [[Directory_of_Important_Information_(DII)#.F0.9F.94.A5_Corp_Policies_.F0.9F.94.A5|'''listed here''']].

=== Activity Requirements ===

'''New members are required to publish an introductory post on the EvE-Scout Enclave Discord server within their FIRST 72 HOURS in the corp.'''
* Intros should be posted in our &lt;code>[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128086787605151764 üó™hello-farewell-afk]&lt;/code> Discord forum channel.
** Be sure to use the "Hello" tag when you post.
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#First_72_Hours: | Read this before posting]].
* Failure to do this can get you kicked from the corp without notice.

There is no general requirement to be on voice comms, however joining our [[#Discord | Discord]] is mandatory. Signal Cartel Fleet FCs may require all fleet members to be on comms; if a member does not get on comms in such situations, the FC is within their rights to kick said member from the fleet.

Leadership does not impose specific in-game activity requirements on members. However, the expectation is for members to be primarily engaged in '''exploration activities''' and to login regularly for reasonable periods of time. Members who fail to login for 60 days or more or who join and then fail to show a pattern of regular exploration-related activities after joining are considered inactive (or warehoused alts) and will be kicked.

Kicked members in good standing can rejoin when they are ready to be active again, once any ban associated with their rejoin timer has expired. However, Leadership has a policy against bouncing in and out of the corp. See the [[#Rejoin_Timer | Rejoin Timer]] and [[#Bouncing_Bans | Bouncing Bans]] sections below.

If a member has been visibly active, highly engaged, and a contributing to Signal Cartel but must be away from EVE for an extended period of time due to deployment or other RL reasons, let Leadership know. Per Leadership's discretion, the member may be given the Keep List (KL) title which forgives inactivity over a longer period of time. The KL title is a privilege earned through being a demonstrably active member. It is not a right nor is it given to those members who are not active across the metrics by which Leadership measures activity (logins, participation in SC programs, exploration-related ship losses, activity on Discord, and activity in Alliance or EvE-Scout in-game chats).

'''Why are long-term inactives kicked?''' Because Leadership prefers that the official SC membership count reflect, as accurately as possible, members that are actively logging in to play on a reasonably regular basis. The intent is to actively avoid being an alt warehouse or a corp full of dead weight. This goal is important to both internal and external perceptions of SC corp vitality and its potential relative to in-game events that SC participates in.

=== Rejoin Timer ===

If a member quits or is kicked for inactivity, an automatic timer is triggered, during which time they are banned and cannot rejoin SC. The duration of the ban is scaled based on the player's most recent time in corp (not accumulated time over multiple memberships) and is displayed on their SC membership record (visible only to leadership/recruiters). See the chart below for duration details. This policy reflects the Leadership Team's desire to foster a committed, actively engaged community as well as discourage corp bouncing/alt warehousing and to cut down on our recruiters‚Äô workload.

| ‚â§ 360 days
| 30 day ban
|-
| > 360 days
| No ban
|}

=== Bouncing Bans ===
Bouncing is defined as joining the corp then leaving within two months, then re-joining and leaving again within six months. This practice is discouraged and will get you temp-banned from re-joining for at least six months. Joining and leaving the same day will earn you a permanent ban. Also note that excessive bouncing, regardless of time spent in corp, may lead to a ban or adversely affect any future applications.

=== Signal Cartel Communication ===

==== [[In-Game_Channels_and_Mailing_Lists | In-Game Channels]] ====
* Alliance channel
** Where members chat
** It is very busy
* Corp channel
** Corp-only admin-related chat
** Rarely (if ever) used by members
* EvE-Scout channel
** Public channel for the Alliance, so OPSEC applies
** Players from all playstyles chat here
** Remember that as a representative of Signal Cartel, members must conduct themselves accordingly

==== EVEmail ====

* To mail ALL Signal Cartel corp members, please use Corp mail  
* '''Do not use Alliance mail''' to send mail to everyone. The other two corps in our alliance are populated only by Leadership alts so no Signal Cartel members will be missed by using Corp mail.
* Use Corp mail ONLY for announcements and compiled/aggregated info/stats of interest to the entire corp, NOT for discussion or questions. Direct questions or general info to the original sender, Discord, or Alliance chat.
* Avoid mailing Leadership with questions about ship fits, game mechanics, or other non-admin stuff. Ask instead in Alliance chat or on Discord.

==== Discord ====
* The main out-of-game communication platform used by Signal Cartel.
* Mandatory for all members
* Where we all go to hang out and discuss serious and not-so-serious topics. 
* FCs may require fleet members to be on comms for listening only or with a working mic, at their discretion
* [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|'''Click here''']] for set up instructions and more info on ping triggers and commands.

==== EvE-Scout Forums (historical only) ====
* As of 7-31-2023, the old [https://forums.eve-scout.com EvE-Scout Forums] are now in read-only mode and '''inactive'''.
* An absolute treasure trove of past information.

==== Reddit (historical only) ====
* Reddit resources are '''inactive''' but maintained for historical purposes.
** r/evescout: Public discussion for all explorers and EvE-Scout scouts.
** r/signalcartel: Private subreddit for Signaleers.

=== Member Levels: C1/C2 Titles ===
Signal Cartel has three general membership levels: members, '''C1''' members, and '''C2''' members.  Please note that C2 membership is a prerequisite to apply to certain Signal Cartel programs such as joining the [[AD:Anoikis_Division | Anoikis Division]] and for certain corp positions such as becoming an ESR Coordinator with [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide | Search And Rescue (SAR)]] or an [[TS:Bookmark_Managers|EvE-Scout Mapping Bookmark Manager]].

* '''C1''':
** Can apply after 30 days in corp
** Grants ''view'' access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars#Corporation_Hangars_2 | Shared Corp Hangar]]

* '''C2''':
** Can apply after 60 days in corp
** Must already be a C1
** Grants ''take'' access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars#Corporation_Hangars_2 | Shared Corp Hangar]]
** '''Requires evidence of engagement in exploration and SC corp programs'''

Note that membership upgrades and the associated titles are a privilege, not a right. Membership level upgrades are based on time in corp and assessments of exploration-related activity and participation in corp programs. This is particularly true for being promoted to C2.

'''In a nutshell: No engagement, No membership upgrade'''

Also, there are no exceptions for fast-tracking new members to C1 or C2. Furthermore, members who leave the corp voluntarily or are kicked for inactivity (or other reasons) and then rejoin later lose all "time in corp" status from their previous membership and must wait the requisite 30/60 days to be considered for membership level upgrades. This is done to encourage commitment and discourage bouncing in and out of the corp on a whim.

==== To Request a Title Upgrade ====

Send the [[Policy:Corp_Admin_Info_and_Policies#EvE-Scout_Enclave_Leadership_Team | CEO]] an EVEmail explaining briefly what activities you've been involved with and why you feel you are eligible for an upgrade. At the bare minimum, make sure you have at '''LEAST''' engaged in some discussion on our Discord server before requesting your upgrade.

==== Other Promotional Opportunities ====

There is no routine path in our Alliance to Directorships or roles which provide access to corp hangar assets or structures. Trusted members are assigned to staff positions at Leadership's discretion and are given only the roles needed to perform their specific jobs.

=== Alts ===
''' Signal Cartel is NOT a warehouse for alts.'''  

* If a member wants an alt to join the corp, they may make this request only after earning a C2 title on their main Signal Cartel character.
* In-corp alts must be declared when they apply to join the corp.
** If a member is found to have alts in Signal Cartel that have not been declared, this may result in the immediate removal of the main character, all alts, and a '''permanent ban''' from SC.
* All alts in Signal Cartel are subject to the same activity requirements [[#Activity_Requirements | listed above]].
** This includes making a new intro post on your alt's behalf in our &lt;code>[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128086787605151764 üó™hello-farewell-afk]&lt;/code> Discord forum channel.
*** To do this, please use your main's Discord account and use the "'''Alt'''" tag when you make the intro post for your alt.
* Title "Inheritance" by member's alts
** Members in good standing who have been in the corp for 120 days or longer may request the same assigned titles they have been given for one verified alt they bring into or already have in the corp.
** Inheritance requires both characters to be in the corp.

Please read this for information regarding [[Policy:Alts_and_the_Credo | Alts and The Credo]].

=== Shared Corporate Bookmarks ===
The game limits the number of shared corporate bookmarks.  Some bookmarks are used for insta-undock and for other useful purposes at our office stations and also for the Thera wormhole connection bookmarks. Other bookmarks are used for tacticals saved by Leadership, or are saved temporarily for use during fleet ops or other in-space group activities.

''Do '''not''' save personal bookmarks in Corporate Locations''. Corporate bookmarks can and will be deleted without notice for maintenance purposes, sometimes by accident, and on the rare occasion by a troublemaker. Regardless of the reason, simply do not expect corp bookmarks to persist. Copy the useful bookmarks into your Items Hangar and then to into your Personal Locations folder.

'''CAUTION''' Keep in mind that all Corporate Locations bookmarks have the potential to be compromised by troublemakers or spais, but particularly the insta-undock bookmarks in Thera and in trade hubs like Jita. The only bookmarks members can 100% trust are their own personal bookmarks that are then never shared with anyone else. 

'''Best practices''':  Use the corp bookmarks as a starting point for making your own insta-undock, tactical, and other bookmarks.

=== Corporation Hangars ===
[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Click here]] for detailed info on what is in each of our corporate hangars and how to access them.

=== Other (still important to read) ===

* '''Tax is 10%'''. This income goes toward funding corp overhead, member recognition, and events expenses. Should there be a need to buff the corp coffers, Leadership may (rarely) announce a ‚Äútax income campaign‚Äù where the tax rate is raised very high for a short time period and members are encouraged to engage in taxed activities to help out.
* Many members enjoy building stuff for the corp or donating ISK to help fund overhead, programs, and events: 
** '''To donate ships, supplies, or items''' to the corp, please use the ''Shared Stuff'' corporation hangar at one of our corp office locations.  There is a container called '''*Donations*''' so feel free to drop items in there. Fitted ships can be dropped directly into the ''Shared Stuff'' hangar.  Please see [[CS:Station_Quartermasters|this page]] for more information.
** '''To donate ISK''', right click Signal Cartel --> Give Money and choose the ''Donations'' account. Include a remark as to the intended purpose/use for the ISK. 
*** Note that donations that go to the Master Wallet account (default) often go unnoticed because of the volume of transactions there so please be sure to use the ''Donations'' account.
* '''For security reasons, the roles required to anchor and manage citadels and other structures are not given to line members'''. As a corporation of explorers who live and roam freely across the cluster, the cost, admin burden, and potential diplomatic and war-related complications are out of the scope of SC's organizational focus. Members who wish to anchor their own structures are encouraged to do that with an alt character in an alt corp; line members will not be permitted to anchor structures with their Signal Cartel character. Proposals for Signal Cartel structures to be anchored by Leadership can be submitted to Leadership for consideration but will not be funded by the corp and are unlikely to be approved.
* '''Abyssal Proving Grounds'''. Because of their forced PVP mechanics and potentially negative impact on corp reputation, the Abyssal Proving Grounds are '''off limits''' to members of Signal Cartel. See the rationale behind the decision [[Policy:Abyssal_Proving_Grounds|here]].
