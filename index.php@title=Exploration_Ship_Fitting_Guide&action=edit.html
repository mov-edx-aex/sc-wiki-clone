=General Principles=
Exploration can be done in a wide variety of ships, although some are better suited than others (see [[Exploration ships|here]]). This article will look at the key equipment used for exploring - the rest of the fit will depend on the slots available (and your fitting skills).
==High Slots==
There are two types of high slot modules that are highly useful to explorers: Cloaking Devices and Probe Launchers.
===Cloaking Devices===
Being able to hide while scanning down signatures in a system is highly valuable, and a cloak allows you to do this. Omega clone status is required to use the Cloaking skill which allows access to the modules. The most basic is the Prototype Cloaking Device I, which reduces your sub-light speed to just 10% of normal while cloaked, and can't be used while warping. The T2 module of choice is the Covert Ops Cloaking Device II, which has no reduction to sub-light speed and permits warp drive use while under cloak. The catch with this module is that it can only be fitted on certain ships, however this includes most of the higher-end exploration-bonused ships (such as the Astero, Stratios, Covert Ops frigates and covert-configured Strategic Cruisers).

===Probe Launchers===
For exploration, the standard fit will include a Core Probe Launcher of some description to scan down cosmic signatures. The basic Core Probe Launcher I does the job on a budget price, but with Astrometrics V trained you can fit the T2 Core Probe Launcher II which has a +5% bonus to scan strength. The Sisters Core Probe Launcher is the best, with a +10% bonus to scan strength, lower CPU requirements and only needing Astrometrics I - however, it is extremely expensive in comparison to the other two.
===Interdiction Nullifiers===
These modules can allow escape from non-targeted interdiction "bubbles", and can be activated while under jump cloak. However, they are restricted as to which ships can carry them. For exploration, the two main groups are the T2 Covert Ops frigates (including the Pacifier) and T3 Strategic Cruisers (Interdiction Nullification subsystems aren't required to use these modules, but instead give a bonus to their effect). The T1 exploration frigates (Magnate, Heron, Imicus, Probe) and SOE ships (Astero, Stratios) can't fit Interdiction Nullifiers. Interceptors can be Nullified, but their use as "exploceptors" was founded on their innate ability to avoid bubbled gate camps in null sec, which covered their weaknesses (small cargo hold, no scanning or hacking bonus, no Cov Ops cloak). Now that the T2 explorers can gain nullification, the use case for exploceptors is greatly reduced.

==Mid Slots==
===Propulsion Module===
Most fits will include a propulsion module (prop mod) of some kind, and the choice is down to your personal preference. Microwarpdrives give you more speed, but are harder to fit and the increased signature makes it easier for an aggressor to lock on. Afterburners might not be as quick, but don't suffer the same drawbacks as MWDs. In any case, if the cans in the site that you are hacking are far apart, it is usually quicker to warp to and from an on-grid perch bookmark, rather than slowboating from can to can. It is possible to fit an oversized afterburner to give MWD-like performance without the drawbacks, but this will consume a large proportion of your fitting resources, potentially compromising your fit in other areas (depending on how high your fitting skills are trained).

===Analyzers===
Data and Relic Analyzers are what you need to open the cans in their respective sites. The T1 versions grant 40 Coherence and 20 Strength as a base, and both have a T2 version available that starts with 60 Coherence and 30 Strength. You will need both modules if you wish to do both kinds of site, unless you fit an Integrated Analyzer that can hack both types of site. They only occupy one mid slot, but have less Coherence and Utility Slots than the dedicated Analyzers and are usually a lot more expensive, especially if you are using the Blackglass implant (which is what makes the Integrated Analzyers really shine). For more on the mechanics of how to use analyzers, see the [[Hacking]] page.
===Cargo Scanner===
Some fits will include a Cargo Scanner module, which lets you see the contents of a can before you attempt the hack. This allows you to prioritise the most valuable cans, which can be particularly helpful in sites with a hidden timer such as Ghost sites (Covert Research Facilities), where hacking every can is not feasible.
===Scan Arrays=== 
These come in three flavours (rangefinding, pinpointing, acquisition) which improve your scan strength, deviation and cycle time by +5%/-10%/-10% respectively. The T2 versions double the bonus to +10%/-20%/-20%. Like the Cargo Scanner, these are a nice quality of life upgrade, but with good skills they are not strictly necessary if you are flying an exploration-bonused ship.
===Shield Tank===
It is generally '''not''' worthwhile to install shield tanking modules on your exploration ship - you need the space for the modules above, and so you will usually struggle to make a solid tank without compromising your exploration ability. Shields also increase your signature radius, making it easier for an aggressor to target lock you.

==Low Slots==
Low slots don't offer any direct bonuses to exploration, but can still provide useful defensive boosts.
===Agility Modules===
Inertial Stabilizers and Nanofiber Internal Structure modules both increase your agility, which will improve your time to align and warp - this is an excellent defence against hunters as you can usually warp away before they can lock on. An Astero with some of these fitted can align in under two seconds, and the Covert Ops frigates can align in under three seconds. Both types of module have a drawback: Inertial Stabilizers increase your signature radius (making it easier for a hunter to lock you) and Nanofiber Internal Structure reduces your hull hit points (and for the frigates in particular, your tank is paper-thin already). Note that as align time rounds to the next server tick, there is no difference in a time of 1.01 seconds and 1.99 seconds - both will activate warp on 2.0 seconds. This means that there is no point in adding extra agility mods ''unless'' it brings you down into the next server tick bracket. As your skills improve, you will find you need fewer of these modules to reduce your align time, opening up space for other modules.

===Defensive Modules===
If you have space, adding a Damage Control Unit or armour resistance modules can increase your chance of survival if caught in a smartbombing gatecamp or the explosion of a ghost site, although your tank is still relatively weak and won't stand up to the level of punishment that a regular ship of that class could. 
Warp Core Stabilizers work to neutralise the effects of one standard Warp Scrambler (aka Scrams) or two standard Warp Disruptors (aka Points), allowing you to warp away even if a hunter tackles you. However, you can only have one of these modules fitted, and this will not block the more potent variations of Scrams and Points, so is better at fending off opportunists rather than dedicated hunters and/or camps.

===Utility Modules===
Expanded Cargoholds give more space to store your loot, although as a percentage boost it works best on ships that already have a lot of storage, such as cruisers and the T1 frigates. Bear in mind they slow you down and reduce your hull points as well. Overdrive Injectors have an opposite effect, increasing your sublight speed but reducing cargo capacity.

==Rigs==
There are several rigs that are helpful to explorers, but one of the best is the Gravity Capacitor Upgrade, which boosts scan strength by 10% (15% for T2 version). This rig has no drawbacks. 
The other scanning rigs are Emission Scope Sharpeners and Memetic Algorithm Banks, which grant a bonus to Virus Coherence for Relic and Data Analyzers respectively. The bonus is +10 for the T1 version and +20 for the T2.

If you want to boost your alignment speed Low Friction Nozzle Joints are the best for pure inertia reduction, while Polycarbon Engine Housing will blend inertia reduction with a sublight speed boost. Both of these rigs reduce your armour, so are best suited to fits that look to survive by fleeing swiftly rather than attempting to stand and fight.

Cargohold Optimization rigs can boost your cargo storage space by 15% (20% for T2) but also reduce your armour.

Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizers increase warp speed by 20% (25% for T2) at the cost of increased signature radius.

Bear in mind that although the T2 versions have a more potent effect than the corresponding T1 rig, they do have a higher Calibration cost (the resource for fitting rigs), and they usually have a much greater ISK cost as well.

=What to Carry in Cargo=
==Probes==
Probes are the lifeblood of exploration. These will allow you to scan down signatures to find data/relic sites, combat/Sleeper sites and wormholes. It's always good to carry at least one full set of replacement probes in your cargo, for two reasons: 1. You are covering yourself in case of accidental probe loss (such as having them out during server downtime); 2. With a second set in the hold, your Probe Launcher will automatically reload once you launch probes, saving you having to do it manually after recalling your active probes.
===Types of Probes===
*Core Scanner Probe I is the most basic, with a base scan strength of 40 points. The advantage of these is that they are generally very cheap.
*Sisters Core Scanner Probes have a base scan strength of 44, and are a nice upgrade when you have the skills to take advantage of the difference comapred to the T1 basic probes.
*RSS Core Scanner Probes are slightly better than the Sisters, at base scan strength 45. However, they are extremely expensive in comparison and should be used with caution as their use might encourage gankers to start looking for you.

==Mobile Depots==
Can be helpful for larger ships (such as Stratios or the T3Cs) that might have separate fits for scanning/travel/combat, as a Mobile Depot enables you to refit your ship while in space. This can also be done by smaller ships, but the space it takes up (50m³) will reduce the amount of loot that can be carried.

=Drones=
Although drones won't help your exploration directly, a lot of the exploration-focused ships have some drone capacity (especially the Sisters of Eve ships).
*'''Combat drones''' will help out in combat, but as stated above a ship designed to explore will always suffer at the hands of an equivalent ship set up for combat.
*'''ECM drones''' such as the Hornet EC-300 have a chance to break the lock (and therefore point/scram) of an attacker, which will give you an opportunity to warp away. Sacrificing a handful of drones is preferable to losing your ship, loot and possibly your pod in an ambush.
*'''Salvage drones''' give the option to add salvage to your loot, however their chance to salvage per cycle is low (although this can be increased by the Salvage Drone Operation skill), which means you could be waiting a while - and and exposed exploration ship is very vulnerable.

=Implants=
For exploration, there are several implants that boost your exploration abilities.
*For Implant Slots 1-6 there is the Virtue set (available in low-grade and mid-grade only) which increases scan strength by approximately 20% for a full set of low-grade and 34% for full mid-grade.
*For Implant Slots 6, 7 &amp; 8 there are is an implant for each slot that focuses on one scanning skill. Each comes in three levels, giving a bonus of 2%, 6% and 10% respectively to the named skill. 
**Slot 6 Poteque 'Prospector' Astrometric Pinpointing AP-602/AP-606/AP-610 
**Slot 7 Poteque 'Prospector' Astrometric Acquisition AQ-702/AQ-706/AQ-710
**Slot 8 Poteque 'Prospector' Astrometric Rangefinding AR-802/AR-806/AR-810
*Slots 9 and 10 can also have exploration use for helping with access to cans, as outlined on the [[Hacking]] page.

=Signal Cartel Starter Ship Fits=
Signal Cartel maintains a set of suggested set ups using expertise from the [[SW:Splunkworks|Splunkworks]] division. The following fits are the basic starter set ups for the four empires. The in-game fitting window has further Corp fits, including Astero, Stratios and Covert Ops frigates. As with all fitting decisions, you will want to consider your own needs/playstyle, current/future skills and budget (most important!) to create the fit that works best for ''you''. You can experiment with different fits using the in-game fitting window or offline using tools such as PYFA (Python Fitting Assistant), available here: [https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa PYFA at Github]
