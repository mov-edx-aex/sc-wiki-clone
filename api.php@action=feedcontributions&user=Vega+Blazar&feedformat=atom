&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;big&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Hello and Welcome to Signal Cartel!&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/big&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel New Member Orientation Guide&#039;&#039;&#039; is designed to help you get started on your journey as a “Signaleer”, our affectionate name for a Signal Cartel capsuleer. It provides critical information on our policies, communication channels, apps, services, and divisions within the corp. If you are new to EVE, we have a number of resources available to help you develop the skills and knowledge to successfully explore New Eden. We regularly hold talks and classes on many aspects of the game that are designed for new and experienced pilots alike. Our aim is to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for all explorers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The format of the Orientation Guide has been conveniently divided into sections that correspond to your time in the corp. Our intent with this approach is to slowly ease you into our corp life and culture while making it as informative and fun as possible. Let&#039;s get started...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Please note that Signal Cartel utilizes EVE Online to verify your identity and corp membership.  For possibly the first 24 hours* after you join us, you may be unable to access our non-public/protected corp systems and assets.  Read below for more info regarding this topic.&lt;br /&gt;
 *Exception: forums.eve-scout.com may take up to 7 days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== The Credo ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the moment you joined Signal Cartel, our &#039;&#039;&#039;[[Public:About_Signal_Cartel#Corp_Credo | Credo]]&#039;&#039;&#039; is no longer an abstract idea. Every action of a Signaleer is expected to be compliant with the Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some Credo statements, such as the prohibition of “initiating aggression on other players’ ships, pods, or deployed structures,” are unambiguous, and there is no excuse to breach such requirements. Others describe concepts and ideals that may be subject to interpretation. For example, the meaning of neutrality has been a topic of some robust debates within the corporation. A Credo-compliant course of action may not be obvious in every situation; Signaleers are expected to use their best judgment and, if in doubt, discuss the options with experienced corp mates and management.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the Credo, Signal Cartel has a number of policies that corp members must know and follow. You will get access to all policies within 24 hours of joining the corp, but for now, please take note of our Code of Conduct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Code of Conduct ==&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the [[Public:About_Signal_Cartel#Corp_Credo | Credo]], we have a family-friendly rule, both in both language and topic, for all in- and out-of-game communications channels/platforms. This extends to character biographies, character names, and includes any linked content. Many of our members have children or early teens who may be watching or listening to them play. Therefore, we do not tolerate toxic, vulgar, hateful, mean-spirited, or foul-natured conduct or language.  We do not tolerate drama or rabble-rousing. The one thing we hear most often from departing or returning members is that “this is the nicest corp and group of people I’ve ever met in a game” and that is exactly how we aim to keep it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, Signal Cartel members recognize the dignity and worth of every person in New Eden. Our aim is to create a climate of understanding and mutual respect so that each person feels a part of and is able to contribute to our community. To that end, discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to age, sex, gender, sexual identity, nationality, or ethnicity, is not tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, please avoid real-life (RL) politics, religion, and other controversial RL topics in all our communication channels/platforms. Members are here to play a game, enjoy each other&#039;s company, escape RL for a bit, and have fun. Conversations should primarily be related to the game and associated events and meta activities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Wars ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel does not declare wars, but wars are often declared against us by other corporations and alliances. While we are at war, members of the aggressor corporation may freely attack Signaleers in high security (high-sec) space. If the corporation is already at war when you joined Signal Cartel, you will not receive any notification but the top-left corner of your game client screen will contain this symbol:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WarsImage.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While we are at war, extra caution is recommended while navigating high-sec. Here are some tips which will increase your chance of survival:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Avoid trade hubs (Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, Hek, Rens) and choke point systems along the popular trade routes that lead to them (ex. Ahbazon, Sivala, Tama, and Uedama).&lt;br /&gt;
* Use the free Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS) to safely move your stuff to one of our corporation bases in high-sec.&lt;br /&gt;
** More info on SCRAMS will be provided later in this guide. &lt;br /&gt;
* Use [https://carrier-logistics.space/ Carrier Logistics] to sell your loot without having to haul it to a trade hub.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Your First 24 Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many out-of-game tools and communication channels used by Signal Cartel are available to corp members only. They rely on EVE to verify your identity and corp membership. Due to the way that EVE updates your information, you may find that you are unable to access our out-of-game systems until the next EVE downtime. This could take up to 24 hours (or up to 7 days for our old [https://forums.eve-scout.com/ EvE-Scout Forums] that are now in read-only mode), depending on the time you joined the corp. This is entirely normal and does not mean that your application has been rejected or that there is a problem with your membership invite. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite temporarily not being able to access certain out-of-game corp assets within the first 24 hours of joining Signal Cartel, there are still a number of optional things you can do during this waiting period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some suggested activities:&lt;br /&gt;
* Enable the “Auto Reject Dueling Invitations” setting to prevent inadvertent Credo violations, as participating in duels will be viewed as directly seeking PVP. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Auto_reject_dueling_ssgrab.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Train Anchoring skill to level 1. This is an essential skill for Signaleers who wish to participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache program as it is required to sow a replacement rescue cache.  Training Anchoring to 1 will take you just under half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;
** The Anchoring skillbook is available to &amp;quot;buy and inject&amp;quot; and is also on the market for usually a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;
** Additionally, our Station Quartermasters have this skillbook stocked in our corp hangars. Ask a fellow Signaleer that has a C2 title for details!  &lt;br /&gt;
* Connect to a few of our shared bookmark folders:&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Signal Cartel&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; folder is found in the Corp in-game chat channel&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;EVE-Scout \\ Thera&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; folder is found in both the Alliance and Corp in-game chat channels&lt;br /&gt;
* Install [https://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome] browser. Signal Cartel uses a number of out-of-game tools, such as our co-pilot, Allison. These typically work in various browsers, but our Engineering team officially supports only Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;
* Start learning the lingo. If you are completely new to EVE Online, this can be a daunting task.  Here are two resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - a browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
** [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any questions or need help, please post to the in-game Alliance chat channel (we do not use the Corp channel) or the public channel of our [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|Discord server]] - there will be a number of members willing to help. Even if you don’t have any questions or issues, feel free to just say hello. We’re very happy to meet you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Who Is Who ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a number of [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Org_Chart|key personnel]] within Signal Cartel who you will encounter on a regular basis. These individuals are responsible for leading our organization and also for the [[Public:Divisions | various programs and initiatives]] within Signal Cartel.  They are always willing to answer any questions you may have.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;big&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Hello and Welcome to Signal Cartel!&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/big&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel New Member Orientation Guide&#039;&#039;&#039; is designed to help you get started on your journey as a “Signaleer”, our affectionate name for a Signal Cartel capsuleer. It provides critical information on our policies, communication channels, apps, services, and divisions within the corp.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While we take exploration seriously, Signal Cartel as a whole is pretty laid back corporation as long as some basic ground rules are followed.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Org_Chart | EvE-Scout]], our sister corporation, operates this service within Thera and Turnur as a crowdsourced endeavor tasked with scanning and recording the current wormhole access locations into the hub systems.  Thera Scanning is the original project that led to the creation of the EvE-Scout Enclave alliance and Signal Cartel!  Our Scanners are compensated by the generous donations of those that find our service invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For TripTiks:&lt;br /&gt;
== What Are TripTiks? ==&lt;br /&gt;
TripTiks are one-sheet expedition plans listing waypoints of interest and providing fact-based information about them. Our vision is that capsuleers will use them as navigation guides to visit the waypoints and — prompted by the information in the TripTik — learn more about the interesting things discovered there.&lt;br /&gt;

== TripTik Migration to the Wiki ==&lt;br /&gt;
We&#039;re moving all of our existing TripTiks from [https://signalcartel.org/expedition-triptiks signalcartel.org] to the wiki.  Hopefully, this will make them easier to create, maintain, and curate over time.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;How to Help:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
# Pick an Expedition TripTik from the table below that hasn&#039;t already been claimed.&lt;br /&gt;
# To claim your TripTik, please add your name and update its status to &amp;quot;WIP&amp;quot; by editing the table below.&lt;br /&gt;
# Next, open your TripTik page and transfer the original TripTik info located at [https://signalcartel.org/expedition-triptiks signalcartel.org] into your page.&lt;br /&gt;
## Please use our [[Expedition_TripTik_Template|Expedition TripTik Wiki Page Mockup]] as a format/style guide. If you press the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; button on the Mockup page you will see the wikicode that you copy/paste into your own page.  Afterwards, please press the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Cancel&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; button on the Mockup page so you do not alter it for others.  &lt;br /&gt;
## Make sure to properly use the TripTikNavi infobox template on your TripTik page.  Here are the instructions: [[Template:TripTikNavi/doc]].&lt;br /&gt;
## &#039;&#039;&#039;NOTE:&#039;&#039;&#039; The footer on the TripTik Wiki Page Template is a WIP and is not done yet, so leave this info blank for now on your own page. &lt;br /&gt;
## Here are two examples of a successfully migrated TripTik for your reference: [[The_Elder_War_Tour|The Elder War Tour]] and [[Ancient_Races_of_New_Eden|Ancient Races of New Eden]].&lt;br /&gt;
# Did you double check your work?  Are all those hyperlinks working and pointing in the right direction?!  &lt;br /&gt;
# Once you&#039;re finished-finished, please DM [https://evewho.com/character/94500439 Jen Hoshi] on Discord so that your work can be reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;
# After your page is approved, change the status of your TripTik on the table below from &amp;quot;WIP&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Migrated&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
# Nice!  Now go do another one... ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[http://sclh.ddns.net/ &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel&#039;s Little Helper&#039;&#039;&#039;] is a web-based tool that allows users to quickly determine the danger level of a system by giving an overview of each pilot&#039;s PVP history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel&#039;s Little Helper was designed by fellow Signaleer &#039;&#039;&#039;Portia Tigana&#039;&#039;&#039; and inspired by the now depreciated [http://eve-plh.com/#/home Pirate&#039;s Little Helper].&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
To Use:&lt;br /&gt;
* Select all the pilots from your local in-game chat window&lt;br /&gt;
* Copy&lt;br /&gt;
* Paste them into the tool&lt;br /&gt;
* Click &amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will then see an overview of each pilot&#039;s PvP history and other useful information. The data displayed is pulled from CCP and zKillboard.com.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== 📡 Welcome to Scan Club! 📡 == &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[https://evewho.com/character/96079190 Thrice Hapus] originally launched Scan Club in 2017.  [https://evewho.com/character/95988152 System Baud] took over the reins in 2019 and now, since 2021, [https://evewho.com/character/2116458565 Vega Blazar] is leading the scan party! 🥳 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As explorers, we’re always scanning.  Speed and efficiency in scanning equates to more productivity, which enables us to accomplish our goals.  However, exploration is dangerous, and we have to constantly balance the risk of being podded with any potential rewards.  This usually means we choose to fly sensible ships that get the job done because you never know when that cloaky Loki is going to show up.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scan Club is different.  Scan Club is about throwing caution to the wind and extracting every ounce of scan power from a ship.  We aim to create the equivalent of a Formula One car.  Why?  Because we can and also to help boost our own knowledge about the vital skill of scanning.  Hopefully, the club will also encourage our fellow Signaleers to learn more about it too!  From ship fittings, to implants, to technique, Scan Club is here for your braggadocio and comradery.  Zoom, Zoom! Let&#039;s get started...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Scan Strength ===&lt;br /&gt;
Base scan strength is determined by what sort of probes you have in your launcher. RSS Core Scanner Probes have the highest base at 45, which is only one point better than Sisters Core Scanner probes -- and that single point comes at a considerable price differential.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On top of the base value, four bonus areas are applied as multipliers to arrive at the total scan strength value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These four areas are:&lt;br /&gt;
* Skills - having all Scanning skills to V helps, but Astrometrics and Astrometric Rangefinding are the two most critical.&lt;br /&gt;
* Modules - a Sisters Core Probe Launcher, one or more Scan Rangefinding Array IIs, and Gravity Capacitor Upgrade IIs are essential gear.&lt;br /&gt;
* Implants - the Mid-grade Virtue set (slots 1-6) plus the Prospector AR-810 (slot 8 ) are what you&#039;re after.&lt;br /&gt;
* Ship - some ships, like the Astero, get a flat 37.5% bonus to Core Scanner Probe Strength, while Covert Ops pilots with the skill trained to V get a 50% bonus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Example:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Scan Club Scan Strength Example.png|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== How the Heck is the Total Bonus Calculated? ====&lt;br /&gt;
Former Signaleer, [https://evewho.com/character/94524325 Po Huit], figured out the calculation [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/2241/scanning-club/32 here]. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
==== Max Scan Strength? ====&lt;br /&gt;
With perfect skills and the right gear, the current Scan Club max scan strength record is &#039;&#039;&#039;225.7&#039;&#039;&#039;.  Last checked though, [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/1075/how-much-core-probe-do-i-need-exactly 105 is good enough] to scan down anything in space. Is more than 225.7 possible?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Much ISK Will a Blinged Out Scan Club Ship Cost Me? ===&lt;br /&gt;
If you have to ask, just...don&#039;t. 🤑💸&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== How Does One Become a Member of Scan Club? ==&lt;br /&gt;
Scan Club is open to any Signaleer whose ship attains a &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:#00FF00&amp;quot;&amp;gt;scan strength of 200 or more&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; and then actively uses it in service to New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== To Join, Just Follow These Simple Steps: ===&lt;br /&gt;
Post in [https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1130611978759581726 this Discord forum thread] a &#039;&#039;single high resolution screenshot&#039;&#039;, while in space with your probes deployed, with all the necessary details and you will be welcomed into the club.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your single screenshot &#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039; include &#039;&#039;&#039;ALL&#039;&#039;&#039; four of these items:&lt;br /&gt;
* Scan Strength (hover your mouse over the scan strength number in the probe scanner window to display)&lt;br /&gt;
* Your Ship Fitting in &#039;&#039;list form&#039;&#039; (fitting management window)&lt;br /&gt;
* Your character sheet showing your Implants&lt;br /&gt;
* Your skill sheet displaying ALL seven of your Scanning skills&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance#Leadership|Leadership&#039;s]] favorite things to do is award medals to our members to recognize and honor corp - or alliance - related accomplishments, initiatives, or actions. Since it is difficult for Leadership to keep up with what everyone is doing, here is your opportunity to nominate folks who you feel deserve medals for things you have observed them doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== What Medals Exist? ===&lt;br /&gt;
We have defined quite a few medals. You can see the existing list on our [[Medals_and_Decorations|&#039;&#039;&#039;Medals and Decorations&#039;&#039;&#039;]] page or by opening the Corporation panel (&#039;&#039;click stylized &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; at top of Neocom --&amp;gt; Social --&amp;gt; Corporation&#039;&#039;) in-game and looking for the &#039;&#039;Decorations&#039;&#039; tab. Medals are listed there; hovering over or clicking on a medal will reveal its description. Expanding the submenu under each medal will let you view recipients. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On our [[Medals and Decorations]] page under section 1 &amp;quot;Membership Medals&amp;quot;, you will find the medals that members can nominate other Signaleers for. Section 2 &amp;quot;Division Medals&amp;quot; contains medals that are awarded by their respective divisions for various levels of participation in that division. Section 3 &amp;quot;Special Medals&amp;quot; contains medals that were awarded for specific events, for one-time awards, or are comedy medals that we will no longer award because we like medals to be given for meaningful, well-deserved reasons. Lastly, section 4 &amp;quot;Retired Medals&amp;quot; contains medals that are no longer awarded or have been replaced by a new active medal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Nomination Guidelines ===&lt;br /&gt;
* You can nominate yourself or another. Nominees must be current Signal Cartel members; game mechanics do not allow medals to be awarded to those outside the corp. Self-nominations require validation by at least one other pilot who was involved in the actions for which a pilot seeks recognition. That validation should be EVEmailed to the CEO.&lt;br /&gt;
* The actions of pilots who are not in Signal (including former Signaleers) cannot be recognized by awarding medals to their in-corp alts. The character being nominated for a medal must be the one that has done whatever it is they are getting a medal nomination for doing.&lt;br /&gt;
* Nominations &#039;&#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039;&#039; be for specific medals for specific pilots. No generic &amp;quot;anyone who does x should get z&amp;quot; nominations.&lt;br /&gt;
* Every nomination must be accompanied by a few sentences of explanation for why you think the medal is deserved.&lt;br /&gt;
* Medal nominations associated with fleet activities require FC verification of nominee participation. It is usually easiest if the FC is the one who nominates fleet participants for related medals.&lt;br /&gt;
* Feel free to nominate someone for a medal at any time.&lt;br /&gt;
* Although we have issued some silly medals in the past, we are not keen on perpetuating frivolous nonsense medal awards and will no longer honor such requests.&lt;br /&gt;
* Nominations are no guarantee of an award. Medals are awarded at the discretion of Leadership.&lt;br /&gt;

=== How to Submit a Nomination ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please submit nominations via [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekPXZez_2KNFfuJuPA1rOctjxgDie8UxpRkHyx6N0HglJBZQ/viewform &#039;&#039;&#039;this Google Form].&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Leadership will assess nominations and award medals as appropriate on an ongoing basis. They are subscribed by email to nomination requests and will receive alerts when one is added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Proposing the Creation of a New Medal ===&lt;br /&gt;
In the case that no existing medal suits the reason you are nominating for a medal, you can suggest a new medal be created by &#039;&#039;&#039;EVEmailing&#039;&#039;&#039; the CEO a well-considered and well-written name and description for the new medal. We will generally only entertain new medal suggestions if the medal can be potentially used for others going forward. Single-use medals will only be created in extremely extraordinary circumstances. Keep in mind that medals cost 5M to create, then 5M each time they are awarded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When proposing new medals, provide a proposed name and BRIEF description that, in a perfect world, we can copy-paste when creating the medal in-game. In reality, both will likely be changed. Leadership has a thing about medal names. The best medal names reflect who we are, are dignified, and maybe clever in some classy way. You can&#039;t always hit all three criteria but aim high.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Medals can only be created by the CEO, Directors, and Recruiters who have access to a Corp wallet division. Once created, they can&#039;t be removed nor can names/descriptions be edited without submitting a support ticket. We get why CCP designed it that way...it prevents retro trolling of pilots later (medals are a permanent part of a pilot&#039;s record). But it also means that we aim to get medal names and descriptions right the first time so we don&#039;t have to bother the GMs with clerical requests.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of [https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance#Leadership Leadership&#039;s] favorite things to do is award medals to our members to recognize and honor corp - or alliance - related accomplishments, initiatives, or actions. Since it is difficult for Leadership to keep up with what everyone is doing, here is your opportunity to nominate folks who you feel deserve medals for things you have observed them doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== What Medals Exist? ===&lt;br /&gt;
We have defined quite a few medals. You can see the existing list on our [[Medals_and_Decorations|&#039;&#039;&#039;Medals and Decorations&#039;&#039;&#039;]] page or by opening the Corporation panel (&#039;&#039;click stylized &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; at top of Neocom --&amp;gt; Social --&amp;gt; Corporation&#039;&#039;) in-game and looking for the &#039;&#039;Decorations&#039;&#039; tab. Medals are listed there; hovering over or clicking on a medal will reveal its description. Expanding the submenu under each medal will let you view recipients. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On our [[Medals and Decorations]] page under section 1 &amp;quot;Membership Medals&amp;quot;, you will find the medals that members can nominate other Signaleers for. Section 2 &amp;quot;Division Medals&amp;quot; contains medals that are awarded by their respective divisions for various levels of participation in that division. Section 3 &amp;quot;Special Medals&amp;quot; contains medals that were awarded for specific events, for one-time awards, or are comedy medals that we will no longer award because we like medals to be given for meaningful, well-deserved reasons. Lastly, section 4 &amp;quot;Retired Medals&amp;quot; contains medals that are no longer awarded or have been replaced by a new active medal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Nomination Guidelines ===&lt;br /&gt;
* You can nominate yourself or another. Nominees must be current Signal Cartel members; game mechanics do not allow medals to be awarded to those outside the corp. Self-nominations require validation by at least one other pilot who was involved in the actions for which a pilot seeks recognition. That validation should be EVEmailed to the CEO.&lt;br /&gt;
* The actions of pilots who are not in Signal (including former Signaleers) cannot be recognized by awarding medals to their in-corp alts. The character being nominated for a medal must be the one that has done whatever it is they are getting a medal nomination for doing.&lt;br /&gt;
* Nominations &#039;&#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039;&#039; be for specific medals for specific pilots. No generic &amp;quot;anyone who does x should get z&amp;quot; nominations.&lt;br /&gt;
* Every nomination must be accompanied by a few sentences of explanation for why you think the medal is deserved.&lt;br /&gt;
* Medal nominations associated with fleet activities require FC verification of nominee participation. It is usually easiest if the FC is the one who nominates fleet participants for related medals.&lt;br /&gt;
* Feel free to nominate someone for a medal at any time.&lt;br /&gt;
* Although we have issued some silly medals in the past, we are not keen on perpetuating frivolous nonsense medal awards and will no longer honor such requests.&lt;br /&gt;
* Nominations are no guarantee of an award. Medals are awarded at the discretion of Leadership.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How to Submit a Nomination ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please submit nominations via [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekPXZez_2KNFfuJuPA1rOctjxgDie8UxpRkHyx6N0HglJBZQ/viewform &#039;&#039;&#039;this Google Form].&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Leadership will assess nominations and award medals as appropriate on an ongoing basis. They are subscribed by email to nomination requests and will receive alerts when one is added.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Please read and incorporate the following information into your Fleet Announcement.  Organizing fleets takes a lot of work and coordination.  The following template will hopefully allow you to easily communicate all the relevant facts in an understandable and consistent manner.  Thank you FC!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE:  If you are announcing a fleet sponsored and sanctioned by our [[FOD:Fleet_Operations_Division|Fleet Ops Division (FOD)]], please also refer to [[FOD:Guide_to_Fleet_Announcements|this additional information]].&lt;br /&gt;

# Copy the raw Markdown text in the gray box below and edit to suit.&lt;br /&gt;
## The text inside the square brackets, including the brackets themselves, should be replaced with your custom text.&lt;br /&gt;
## Be careful about two-space breaks at the end of lines.&lt;br /&gt;
# Use a time zone converter.  See [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement#Time_Zone_Converter|below]] for more info.&lt;br /&gt;
## Always use 24-hour UTC aka &amp;quot;EVE Time&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
## Paste the link to the time zone converter as well.&lt;br /&gt;
## If the fleet day is different in UTC than your local time zone because of wrap, make sure you account for it in the announcement to avoid confusion.&lt;br /&gt;
## The in-game EVE Year can be obtained by adding 102 to the last three digits of the out-of-game year: 2023 is YC125, for example.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Time Zone Converter ===&lt;br /&gt;
Fleet announcements are always posted in UTC aka &amp;quot;EVE Time&amp;quot;.  This avoids confusion when Signaleers from different time zones want to partake in your fleet.  There are a few well known time converters that you can use.  However, here are a couple of the easiest:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter Dateful Time Zone Converter]&lt;br /&gt;
** Simple to use and has a &amp;quot;copy link&amp;quot; button &lt;br /&gt;
* [http://time.nakamura-labs.com/ Nakamura Time]&lt;br /&gt;
** EVE specific and shows multiple time zones simultaneously&lt;br /&gt;
** Note that you have to copy the URL from the address bar in order to share your link&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Don&#039;t Forget to Promote It! ===&lt;br /&gt;
You want fellow Signaleers to show up, right?!  Well if you do, [[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|read this]].&lt;br /&gt;

=== What is the Triple Crown? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In order to achieve the arduous yet prestigious Triple Crown, a Signaleer must simultaneously be the Top Cacher, the Top Scanner (Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;or&#039;&#039;&#039; Turnur), and the Top Storm Chaser within the &#039;&#039;&#039;SAME&#039;&#039;&#039; 24 hour time period (aka downtime to downtime).

&lt;div&gt;== The Triple Crown Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At 11:30 UTC each day, Signaleers are recognized as the &#039;&#039;Daily Scout Leaders&#039;&#039; by the Allison bot in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/655834735121268736 #members-lounge]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; channel of our Discord server.

* Top Turnur Scanner 🛰️ - most Turnur wormhole submissions in the previous 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
* Top Storm Chaser 🌧️ - most new metaliminal storm reports in the previous 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== What is the Triple Crown? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In order to achieve the arduous yet prestigious Triple Crown, a Signaleer must simultaneously be the Top Cacher, the Top Scanner (Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;or&#039;&#039;&#039; Turnur), and the Top Storm Chaser within the &#039;&#039;&#039;SAME&#039;&#039;&#039; 24 hour time period (aka downtime to downtime).  A rare feat indeed! 🦄 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== What if I get ALL FOUR?! ===&lt;br /&gt;
If you are the Top Cacher, Top Thera Scanner, Top Turnur Scanner, and Top Storm Chaser within the same 24 hour period, well, we&#039;ll just have to invent a new club for you!  Is it even possible?  You never know until you try... &lt;br /&gt;

		<link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://wiki.signalcartel.space/index.php?title=Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks&amp;diff=14177"/>
		<updated>2024-01-23T06:12:50Z</updated>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vega Blazar: revised wording&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}Signal Cartel offers its members a multitude of meaningful and fun activities, many of which are covered later in this guide. Although the topics are presented in a particular order, Signaleers are encouraged to pick and choose things that interest them. The only exception to this is a series of one-off tasks which new members &#039;&#039;&#039;MUST&#039;&#039;&#039; accomplish within a defined period of time:&lt;br /&gt;
* Read ALL our policies. &lt;br /&gt;
* Set up Discord and publish an Introduction.&lt;br /&gt;
* Meet Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While at first glance this list may look daunting, you&#039;ll finish it in no time if you follow the steps outlined below. However, since we&#039;re all real people with real-life obligations, sometimes things may come up that prevent you from completing these tasks. If so, please let [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Leadership]] know.  They&#039;ll be happy to help you get things sorted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, although you still need to complete all the Mandatory Tasks, there is no strict requirement to finish all the tasks before engaging in other aspects of Signal Cartel corporate life. So don&#039;t feel like you have to read everything before starting your journey with us!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Immediately: Read Orange Policies ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Policy:The_Credo | Signal Cartel’s Credo]] is supported by a number of policies that clarify its application. As these policies facilitate compliance with the Credo, Signaleers are expected to know and follow them. No excuses. Although all policies are equally important, reading and digesting them in one sitting can be an overwhelming task. For this reason, they are grouped by reading priority:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:orange&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Orange List Policies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; must be read as soon as a new member gains access to Signal Cartel resources.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:yellow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yellow List Policies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; (see below) must be read within 7 days of joining Signal Cartel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#1 To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; [[Policy:List_of_Policies|Read Signal Cartel’s policies in the &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:orange&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Orange List&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First 72 Hours: ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Set Up Discord ===&lt;br /&gt;
EvE-Scout Enclave, our Discord server, is the main communication platform used by Signal Cartel.  It&#039;s where we all go to hang out and discuss serious and not-so-serious topics.  Certain channels on the server are also open to the general public, free for all to join, and host a number of people from outside the corporation as guests, together with many New Eden pilots waiting or asking for rescue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining our Discord server and properly authenticating yourself is mandatory for all new corp members.  Discord is also an essential tool for those wishing to take part in our EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC), Search and Rescue (SAR), and EvE-Scout Mapping programs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After being in the corporation for &#039;&#039;at least 24 hours&#039;&#039;, new members (like you!) will be able to authenticate yourself on our Discord server. Doing so will grant you the &#039;&#039;Signaleer&#039;&#039; role on Discord and access to our members-only channels. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#2a To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; Join our Discord server and authenticate yourself using our [[Discord_Authentication_Guide|👉&#039;&#039;&#039;Discord Authentication Guide&#039;&#039;&#039;👈]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: Check out our [[Discord_Channel_Guide|Discord Channel Guide]] for a listing of all our channels along with descriptions. Our [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers|Ping Trigger Quick Reference Guide]] has the most used &amp;amp; useful ping triggers to help you get in touch with people holding different roles within Signal Cartel.  Also, check out [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server#Slash_Commands|Allison&#039;s slash commands]] for fun and useful information provided by our favorite bot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Publish an Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are required to publish an introductory post on our Discord server within 72 hours of joining. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The recommended format of your post is:&lt;br /&gt;
 * What brought you to EVE, how long you’ve played, and what kinds of things you’ve done in-game?&lt;br /&gt;
 * What inspired or how you came up with your character&#039;s name?&lt;br /&gt;
 * How you discovered Signal Cartel and what attracted you to it?&lt;br /&gt;
 * Anything about your real life that you are comfortable sharing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please remember to keep all your communications, including this intro post, family-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#2b To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; Make an intro post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128086787605151764 hello-farewell-afk]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.  Be sure to use the &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; tag when you post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First Week: Read Yellow Policies ==&lt;br /&gt;
By the end of the first week in Signal Cartel, new members must acquaint themselves with the remaining corporation policies.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== First Week: Meet Allison ==&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, by the end of the first week, new members must meet Allison, our official Signal Cartel Co-Pilot. She is implemented as a web application that works in the background and does not interfere with the EVE game client. Her presence is essential for our EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division, which consists of two programs:&lt;br /&gt;
* EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) - You&#039;ll learn more about this program on the next page of the Orientation Guide.&lt;br /&gt;
* Search and Rescue (SAR)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if Signaleers do not want to actively participate in ESR, they can still assist with our SAR efforts of stranded capsuleers by flying through Wormhole Space with Allison enabled.  With Allison enabled, you will help us locate lost pilots just by having Allison passively running in the background. For new pilots, this may be the easiest and the quickest way to become a contributing member of the corporation, while also having an opportunity to earn ISK if you locate a lost pilot! For more information about the role of the Locator in our SAR efforts, please [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide#Role_of_the_Locator|click here]].  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note that although getting acquainted with Allison is a mandatory part of Signal Cartel&#039;s New Member Orientation, pilots are free to deactivate Allison afterward.&lt;br /&gt;

== TripTik Migration to the Wiki ==&lt;br /&gt;
We&#039;re moving all of our existing TripTiks from [https://signalcartel.org/expedition-triptiks signalcartel.org] to the wiki.  Hopefully, this will make them easier to create, maintain, and curate over time.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;How to Help:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
# Pick an Expedition TripTik from the table below that hasn&#039;t already been claimed.&lt;br /&gt;
# To claim your TripTik, please add your name and update its status to &amp;quot;WIP&amp;quot; by editing the table below.&lt;br /&gt;
# Next, open your TripTik page and transfer the original TripTik info located at [https://signalcartel.org/expedition-triptiks signalcartel.org] into your page.&lt;br /&gt;
## Please use our [[Expedition_TripTik_Template|Expedition TripTik Wiki Page Mockup]] as a format/style guide. If you press the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; button on the Mockup page you will see the wikicode that you copy/paste into your own page.  Afterwards, please press the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Cancel&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; button on the Mockup page so you do not alter it for others.  &lt;br /&gt;
## Make sure to properly use the TripTikNavi infobox template on your TripTik page.  Here are the instructions: [[Template:TripTikNavi/doc]].&lt;br /&gt;
## &#039;&#039;&#039;NOTE:&#039;&#039;&#039; The footer on the TripTik Wiki Page Template is a WIP and is not done yet, so leave this info blank for now on your own page. &lt;br /&gt;
## Here are two examples of a successfully migrated TripTik for your reference: [[The_Elder_War_Tour|The Elder War Tour]] and [[Ancient_Races_of_New_Eden|Ancient Races of New Eden]].&lt;br /&gt;
# Did you double check your work?  Are all those hyperlinks working and pointing in the right direction?!  &lt;br /&gt;
# Once you&#039;re finished-finished, please DM [https://evewho.com/character/94500439 Jen Hoshi] on Discord so that your work can be reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;
# After your page is approved, change the status of your TripTik on the table below from &amp;quot;WIP&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Migrated&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
# Nice!  Now go do another one... ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}Signal Cartel offers its members a multitude of meaningful and fun activities, many of which are covered later in this guide. Although the topics are presented in a particular order, Signaleers are encouraged to pick and choose things that interest them. The only exception to this is a series of one-off tasks which new members &#039;&#039;&#039;MUST&#039;&#039;&#039; accomplish within a defined period of time:&lt;br /&gt;
* Read ALL our policies. &lt;br /&gt;
* Set up Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
* Publish an introduction.&lt;br /&gt;
* Meet Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first glance this list may look daunting, just tackle it bit by bit and you&#039;ll finish in no time.  However, since we&#039;re all real people with real-life obligations, if something comes up that prevents you from completing these tasks, please let [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Leadership]] know.  They&#039;ll be happy to help you get things sorted.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note:  While you still need to complete all the Mandatory Tasks, there is no strict requirement to finish all the tasks before engaging in other aspects of Signal Cartel corporate life.  So don&#039;t feel like you have to read everything before starting your journey with us!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Immediately: Read Orange Policies ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Policy:The_Credo | Signal Cartel’s Credo]] is supported by a number of policies that clarify its application. As these policies facilitate compliance with the Credo, Signaleers are expected to know and follow them. No excuses. Although all policies are equally important, reading and digesting them in one sitting can be an overwhelming task. For this reason, they are grouped by reading priority:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:orange&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Orange List Policies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; must be read as soon as a new member gains access to Signal Cartel resources.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:yellow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yellow List Policies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; (see below) must be read within 7 days of joining Signal Cartel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== First 72 Hours: ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Set Up Discord ===&lt;br /&gt;
EvE-Scout Enclave, our Discord server, is the main communication platform used by Signal Cartel.  It&#039;s where we all go to hang out and discuss serious and not-so-serious topics.  Certain channels on the server are also open to the general public, free for all to join, and host a number of people from outside the corporation as guests, together with many New Eden pilots waiting or asking for rescue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining our Discord server and properly authenticating yourself is mandatory for all new corp members.  Discord is also an essential tool for those wishing to take part in our EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC), Search and Rescue (SAR), and EvE-Scout Mapping programs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After being in the corporation for &#039;&#039;at least 24 hours&#039;&#039;, new members (like you!) will be able to authenticate yourself on our Discord server. Doing so will grant you the &#039;&#039;Signaleer&#039;&#039; role on Discord and access to our members-only channels. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#2a To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; Join our Discord server and authenticate yourself using our [[Discord_Authentication_Guide|👉&#039;&#039;&#039;Discord Authentication Guide&#039;&#039;&#039;👈]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: Check out our [[Discord_Channel_Guide|Discord Channel Guide]] for a listing of all our channels along with descriptions. Our [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers|Ping Trigger Quick Reference Guide]] has the most used &amp;amp; useful ping triggers to help you get in touch with people holding different roles within Signal Cartel.  Also, check out [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server#Slash_Commands|Allison&#039;s slash commands]] for fun and useful information provided by our favorite bot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Publish an Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are required to publish an introductory post on our Discord server within 72 hours of joining. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The recommended format of your post is:&lt;br /&gt;
 * What brought you to EVE, how long you’ve played, and what kinds of things you’ve done in-game?&lt;br /&gt;
 * What inspired or how you came up with your character&#039;s name?&lt;br /&gt;
 * How you discovered Signal Cartel and what attracted you to it?&lt;br /&gt;
 * Anything about your real life that you are comfortable sharing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please remember to keep all your communications, including this intro post, family-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#2b To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; Make an intro post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128086787605151764 hello-farewell-afk]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.  Be sure to use the &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; tag when you post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First Week: Read Yellow Policies ==&lt;br /&gt;
By the end of the first week in Signal Cartel, new members must acquaint themselves with the remaining corporation policies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#3 To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; [[Policy:List_of_Policies|Read Signal Cartel’s policies in the &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:yellow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yellow List&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We&#039;re moving all of our existing TripTiks from [https://signalcartel.org/expedition-triptiks signalcartel.org] to the wiki.  Hopefully, this will make them easier to create, maintain, and curate over time.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;How to Help:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
# Pick an Expedition TripTik from the table below that hasn&#039;t already been claimed.&lt;br /&gt;
# To claim your TripTik, please add your name and update its status to &amp;quot;WIP&amp;quot; by editing the table below.&lt;br /&gt;
# Next, open your TripTik page and transfer the original TripTik info located at [https://signalcartel.org/expedition-triptiks signalcartel.org] into your page.&lt;br /&gt;
## Please use our [[Expedition_TripTik_Template|Expedition TripTik Wiki Page Mockup]] as a format/style guide. If you press the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; button on the Mockup page you will see the wikicode that you copy/paste into your own page.  Afterwards, please press the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Cancel&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; button on the Mockup page so you do not alter it for others.  &lt;br /&gt;
## Make sure to properly use the TripTikNavi infobox template on your TripTik page.  Here are the instructions: [[Template:TripTikNavi/doc]].&lt;br /&gt;
## &#039;&#039;&#039;NOTE:&#039;&#039;&#039; The footer on the TripTik Wiki Page Template is a WIP and is not done yet, so leave this info blank for now on your own page. &lt;br /&gt;
## Here are two examples of a successfully migrated TripTik for your reference: [[The_Elder_War_Tour|The Elder War Tour]] and [[Ancient_Races_of_New_Eden|Ancient Races of New Eden]].&lt;br /&gt;
# Did you double check your work?  Are all those hyperlinks working and pointing in the right direction?!  &lt;br /&gt;
# Once you&#039;re finished-finished, please DM [https://evewho.com/character/94500439 Jen Hoshi] on Discord so that your work can be reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;
# After your page is approved, change the status of your TripTik on the table below from &amp;quot;WIP&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Migrated&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
# Nice!  Now go do another one... ;)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;big&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Hello and Welcome to Signal Cartel!&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/big&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel New Member Orientation Guide&#039;&#039;&#039; is designed to help you get started on your journey as a “Signaleer”, our affectionate name for a Signal Cartel capsuleer. It provides critical information on our policies, communication channels, apps, services, and divisions within the corp. If you are new to EVE, we have a number of resources available to help you develop the skills and knowledge to successfully explore New Eden. We regularly hold talks and classes on many aspects of the game that are designed for new and experienced pilots alike.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Please note that Signal Cartel utilizes EVE Online to verify your identity and corp membership.  For possibly the first 24 hours* after you join us, you may be unable to access our non-public/protected corp systems and assets.  Read below for more info regarding this topic.&lt;br /&gt;
 *Exception: forums.eve-scout.com may take up to 7 days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== The Credo ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the moment you joined Signal Cartel, our &#039;&#039;&#039;[[Public:About_Signal_Cartel#Corp_Credo | Credo]]&#039;&#039;&#039; is no longer an abstract idea. Every action of a Signaleer is expected to be compliant with the Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some Credo statements, such as the prohibition of “initiating aggression on other players’ ships, pods, or deployed structures,” are unambiguous, and there is no excuse to breach such requirements. Others describe concepts and ideals that may be subject to interpretation. For example, the meaning of neutrality has been a topic of some robust debates within the corporation. A Credo-compliant course of action may not be obvious in every situation; Signaleers are expected to use their best judgment and, if in doubt, discuss the options with experienced corp mates and management.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the Credo, Signal Cartel has a number of policies that corp members must know and follow. You will get access to all policies within 24 hours of joining the corp, but for now, please take note of our Code of Conduct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Code of Conduct ==&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the [[Public:About_Signal_Cartel#Corp_Credo | Credo]], we have a family-friendly rule, both in both language and topic, for all in- and out-of-game communications channels/platforms. This extends to character biographies, character names, and includes any linked content. Many of our members have children or early teens who may be watching or listening to them play. Therefore, we do not tolerate toxic, vulgar, hateful, mean-spirited, or foul-natured conduct or language.  We do not tolerate drama or rabble-rousing. The one thing we hear most often from departing or returning members is that “this is the nicest corp and group of people I’ve ever met in a game” and that is exactly how we aim to keep it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, Signal Cartel members recognize the dignity and worth of every person in New Eden. Our aim is to create a climate of understanding and mutual respect so that each person feels a part of and is able to contribute to our community. To that end, discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to age, sex, gender, sexual identity, nationality, or ethnicity, is not tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, please avoid real-life (RL) politics, religion, and other controversial RL topics in all our communication channels/platforms. Members are here to play a game, enjoy each other&#039;s company, escape RL for a bit, and have fun. Conversations should primarily be related to the game and associated events and meta activities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Wars ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel does not declare wars, but wars are often declared against us by other corporations and alliances. While we are at war, members of the aggressor corporation may freely attack Signaleers in high security (high-sec) space. If the corporation is already at war when you joined Signal Cartel, you will not receive any notification but the top-left corner of your game client screen will contain this symbol:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WarsImage.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While we are at war, extra caution is recommended while navigating high-sec. Here are some tips which will increase your chance of survival:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Avoid trade hubs (Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, Hek, Rens) and choke point systems along the popular trade routes that lead to them (ex. Ahbazon, Sivala, Tama, and Uedama).&lt;br /&gt;
* Use the free Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS) to safely move your stuff to one of our corporation bases in high-sec.&lt;br /&gt;
** More info on SCRAMS will be provided later in this guide. &lt;br /&gt;
* Use [https://carrier-logistics.space/ Carrier Logistics] to sell your loot without having to haul it to a trade hub.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Your First 24 Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many out-of-game tools and communication channels used by Signal Cartel are available to corp members only. They rely on EVE to verify your identity and corp membership. Due to the way that EVE updates your information, you may find that you are unable to access our out-of-game systems until the next EVE downtime. This could take up to 24 hours (or up to 7 days for our old [https://forums.eve-scout.com/ EvE-Scout Forums] that are now in read-only mode), depending on the time you joined the corp. This is entirely normal and does not mean that your application has been rejected or that there is a problem with your membership invite. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite temporarily not being able to access certain out-of-game corp assets within the first 24 hours of joining Signal Cartel, there are still a number of optional things you can do during this waiting period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some suggested activities:&lt;br /&gt;
* Enable the “Auto Reject Dueling Invitations” setting to prevent inadvertent Credo violations, as participating in duels will be viewed as directly seeking PVP. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Auto_reject_dueling_ssgrab.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Train Anchoring skill to level 1. This is an essential skill for Signaleers who wish to participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache program as it is required to sow a replacement rescue cache.  Training Anchoring to 1 will take you just under half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;
** The Anchoring skillbook is available to &amp;quot;buy and inject&amp;quot; and is also on the market for usually a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;
** Additionally, our Station Quartermasters have this skillbook stocked in our corp hangars. Ask a fellow Signaleer that has a C2 title for details!  &lt;br /&gt;
* Connect to a few of our shared bookmark folders:&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Signal Cartel&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; folder is found in the Corp in-game chat channel&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;EVE-Scout \\ Thera&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; folder is found in both the Alliance and Corp in-game chat channels&lt;br /&gt;
* Install [https://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome] browser. Signal Cartel uses a number of out-of-game tools, such as our co-pilot, Allison. These typically work in various browsers, but our Engineering team officially supports only Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;
* Start learning the lingo. If you are completely new to EVE Online, this can be a daunting task.  Here are two resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - a browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
** [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any questions or need help, please post to the in-game Alliance chat channel (we do not use the Corp channel) or the public channel of our [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|Discord server]] - there will be a number of members willing to help. Even if you don’t have any questions or issues, feel free to just say hello. We’re very happy to meet you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Who Is Who ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a number of [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Org_Chart|key personnel]] within Signal Cartel who you will encounter on a regular basis. These individuals are responsible for leading our organization and also for the [[Public:Divisions | various programs and initiatives]] within Signal Cartel.

== Next Step ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Important:&#039;&#039;&#039; As soon as you gain access to the protected areas of this wiki and our corp Discord, you must read the next section of the New Member Orientation Guide and complete the mandatory tasks within their stipulated timeframes.

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;

* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

== Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within our ranks with those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the reason, the SCA aims to assist new and returning Signaleers with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into the knowledge held by fellow corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA offers two types of educational sessions:&lt;br /&gt;
* Coffee Time - a weekly informal Sunday chat centered loosely around a particular topic. ☕&lt;br /&gt;
* Classes - more formal and structured classroom-style lectures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check out Discord &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Events&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (located at the top of the channel list) for upcoming Coffee Times and Classes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA Discord Session Channels:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is our default voice channel for any SCA session.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is a place share your knowledge and skills and learn from others.  This channel is also used for text chat during ⁠talks/presentations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a particular topic that interests you and don&#039;t see it?  Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy by creating a [NEED] titled new post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;

* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the creation of an [OFFER] post under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

== Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within our ranks with those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the reason, the SCA aims to assist new and returning Signaleers with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into the knowledge held by fellow corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA offers two types of educational sessions:&lt;br /&gt;
* Coffee Time - a weekly informal Sunday chat centered loosely around a particular topic. ☕&lt;br /&gt;
* Classes - more formal and structured classroom-style lectures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check out Discord &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Events&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (located at the top of the channel list) for upcoming Coffee Times and Classes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA Discord Channels:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is our default voice channel for any SCA session.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is a place share your knowledge and skills and learn from others.  This channel is also used for text chat during ⁠talks/presentations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a particular topic that interests you and don&#039;t see it?  Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy by creating a [NEED] titled new post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;

* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the creation of an [OFFER] post under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within our ranks with those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the reason, the SCA aims to assist new and returning Signaleers with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into the knowledge held by fellow corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA offers two types of educational sessions:&lt;br /&gt;
* Coffee Time - a weekly informal Sunday chat centered loosely around a particular topic. ☕&lt;br /&gt;
* Classes - more formal and structured classroom-style lectures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check out Discord &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Events&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (located at the top of the channel list) for upcoming Coffee Times and Classes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Communication Channels:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is our default voice channel for any SCA session.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is a place share your knowledge and skills and learn from others.  This channel is also used for text chat during ⁠talks/presentations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a particular topic that interests you and don&#039;t see it?  Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy by creating a [NEED] titled new post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;

* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship.&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the creation of an [OFFER] post under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

== Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within our ranks with those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the reason, the SCA aims to assist new and returning Signaleers with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into the knowledge held by fellow corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA offers two types of educational sessions:&lt;br /&gt;
* Coffee Time - a weekly informal Sunday chat centered loosely around a particular topic. ☕&lt;br /&gt;
* Classes - more formal and structured classroom-style lectures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check out Discord &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Events&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (located at the top of the channel list) for upcoming Coffee Times and Classes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Communication Channels:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is our default voice channel for any SCA session.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is a place to hangout and share your knowledge and skills and learn from others.  This channel is also used for text chat during ⁠talks/presentations.&lt;br /&gt;

Have a particular topic that interests you and don&#039;t see it?  Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy by creating a [NEED] titled new post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request.&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship.&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the creation of an [OFFER] post under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{SCA}}The Signal Cartel Academy is the educational division of Signal Cartel.  The Academy was established on 23 November 2019 (YC 121) by [[User:Xalyar|Xalyar]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Purpose ===&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the Signal Cartel Academy (SCA) is to lay out a simple and efficient framework that enables access to the wealth of knowledge, skills, and expertise found within Signal Cartel through the exchange of information between Signaleers. The Academy accomplishes this goal by facilitating the meeting of potential mentors and mentees, where &#039;&#039;anyone&#039;&#039; can volunteer their time and knowledge - thus becoming a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentor&#039;&#039;&#039; - for the benefit of anyone - thus becoming a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentee&#039;&#039;&#039; - who feels they need guidance.  Ultimately, SCA is a crowdsourced endeavor that relies on everyone&#039;s participation to flourish. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel Academy isn&#039;t intended to be a rigid structure of classes, qualifications, or courses, even though the plan is to fully incorporate our usual training sessions (ESRC, SAR, Tripwire, Thera and Turnur Mapping) into this framework. The idea is to keep the roles as loose as possible: anyone and everyone is a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentor&#039;&#039;&#039; and a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentee&#039;&#039;&#039;, depending on the situation, and everyone is encouraged to be either as needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Division Management ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Manager: &#039;&#039;&#039;Drer Aideron&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] Assistant Manager for Matchmaking: Frisk Understair&lt;br /&gt;
** Admin Team:&lt;br /&gt;
*** Dagmar Maulerant&lt;br /&gt;

*** Sloopy Noopers&lt;br /&gt;
*** Tekufah&lt;br /&gt;
*** [[User:Xalyar | Xalyar]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Communication ===&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy uses our [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|EvE-Scout Enclave Discord server]] channels:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel - where Signaleers post their education/training announcements and requests&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; - a place to hangout and share your knowledge and skills and learn from others.  This channel is also used for text chat during ⁠talks/presentations.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; - the default voice channel for any SCA session&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Does This Work? ===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Please read:&#039;&#039;&#039; [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|Session Posting Guidelines for Discord]] that explains how to format education/training announcements and requests on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Mentor ====&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel and make a new [OFFER] post listing what you intend to mentor, when you are available, the duration, and the requirements for your mentorship session.  Make sure to use the &amp;quot;Offer&amp;quot; tag as well.  Please share what you know with us and make us all better Signaleers!   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Mentee ====&lt;br /&gt;
The other side of the equation works the same way.  Go to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel and make a new [NEED] post requesting help on a particular topic.  Be sure to use the &amp;quot;Need&amp;quot; tag as well.  Signal Cartel members (old and new) are always encouraged to ask for help.  Please don&#039;t be shy, we are all here to learn and have fun!  &lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel Academy supports the connection of the mentor with the mentee in any way possible.  For instance, if resources are needed for a particular mentoring project, if help is needed to organize it, or if their are questions about how to assist others in Corp, please reach out to the SCA team on the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord channel to discuss what the Academy can do to help make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!-- === Future Plans ===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;One day soon:&#039;&#039;&#039; you&#039;ll be able to head to the &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Academy&#039;&#039;&#039; website/web tool, log in, and just post-up a bulletin that will produce a calendar entry in-game, alert people on DISCORD via a bot, and generate an event that can be joined and managed through the website via a card system looking something like this (credit to [[User:Sky Diamond|Sky Diamond]]&#039;s amazing doodling skills ✏ for this one).&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:SCA_request_example.png|500px]]&lt;br /&gt;
In future, the Signal Cartel Academy will provide a separate website/web tool for people within the Corporation that will work as a marketplace of skills and knowledge, where everyone can volunteer and post offers &amp;amp; requests to volunteer a slice of their time (however much and in any form they want) to help others, teach a specific aspect of EVE, and where people will browse for offers and ask for help as they see fit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE:  The info below was originally in the Orientation Guide.  Removed and placed here in case it&#039;s needed for future use.&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in the corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a Coffee Time or class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the talk (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the talks will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{SCA}}The Signal Cartel Academy is the educational division of Signal Cartel.  The Academy was established on 23 November 2019 (YC 121) by [[User:Xalyar|Xalyar]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Purpose ===&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the Signal Cartel Academy (SCA) is to lay out a simple and efficient framework that enables access to the wealth of knowledge, skills, and expertise found within Signal Cartel through the exchange of information between Signaleers. The Academy accomplishes this goal by facilitating the meeting of potential mentors and mentees, where &#039;&#039;anyone&#039;&#039; can volunteer their time and knowledge - thus becoming a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentor&#039;&#039;&#039; - for the benefit of anyone - thus becoming a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentee&#039;&#039;&#039; - who feels they need guidance.  Ultimately, SCA is a crowdsourced endeavor that relies on everyone&#039;s participation to flourish. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel Academy isn&#039;t intended to be a rigid structure of classes, qualifications, or courses, even though the plan is to fully incorporate our usual training sessions (ESRC, SAR, Tripwire, Thera and Turnur Mapping) into this framework. The idea is to keep the roles as loose as possible: anyone and everyone is a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentor&#039;&#039;&#039; and a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentee&#039;&#039;&#039;, depending on the situation, and everyone is encouraged to be either as needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Communication ===&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy uses our [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|EvE-Scout Enclave Discord server]] channels:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel - where Signaleers post their education/training announcements and requests&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; - a place to hangout and share your knowledge and skills and learn from others&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; - the default voice channel for any SCA session&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Does This Work? ===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Please read:&#039;&#039;&#039; [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|Session Posting Guidelines for Discord]] that explains how to format education/training announcements and requests on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Mentor ====&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel and make a new [OFFER] post listing what you intend to mentor, when you are available, the duration, and the requirements for your mentorship session.  Make sure to use the &amp;quot;Offer&amp;quot; tag as well.  Please share what you know with us and make us all better Signaleers!   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Mentee ====&lt;br /&gt;
The other side of the equation works the same way.  Go to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel and make a new [NEED] post requesting help on a particular topic.  Be sure to use the &amp;quot;Need&amp;quot; tag as well.  Signal Cartel members (old and new) are always encouraged to ask for help.  Please don&#039;t be shy, we are all here to learn and have fun!  &lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel Academy supports the connection of the mentor with the mentee in any way possible.  For instance, if resources are needed for a particular mentoring project, if help is needed to organize it, or if their are questions about how to assist others in Corp, please reach out to the SCA team on the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770316931727379 #sca-campus]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord channel to discuss what the Academy can do to help make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!-- === Future Plans ===&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;One day soon:&#039;&#039;&#039; you&#039;ll be able to head to the &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Academy&#039;&#039;&#039; website/web tool, log in, and just post-up a bulletin that will produce a calendar entry in-game, alert people on DISCORD via a bot, and generate an event that can be joined and managed through the website via a card system looking something like this (credit to [[User:Sky Diamond|Sky Diamond]]&#039;s amazing doodling skills ✏ for this one).&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:SCA_request_example.png|500px]]&lt;br /&gt;
In future, the Signal Cartel Academy will provide a separate website/web tool for people within the Corporation that will work as a marketplace of skills and knowledge, where everyone can volunteer and post offers &amp;amp; requests to volunteer a slice of their time (however much and in any form they want) to help others, teach a specific aspect of EVE, and where people will browse for offers and ask for help as they see fit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in the corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vega Blazar: /* Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk */&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA offers two educational platforms:&lt;br /&gt;
* Coffee Time - a weekly informal chat usually centered around a particular topic and held on Sundays. ☕&lt;br /&gt;
* Classes - more formal and structured classroom-style lectures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note:  Check out our Discord server&#039;s &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Events&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (located at the top of the channel list) for upcoming Coffee Times and Classes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Requesting a more formal &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as Discord authorization has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request.&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship.&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in the corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;

As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Talk ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SCA offers two educational platforms:&lt;br /&gt;
* Coffee Time - a weekly informal chat usually centered around a particular topic and held on Sundays. ☕&lt;br /&gt;
* Classes - more formal and structured classroom-style lectures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note:  Check out our Discord server&#039;s &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Events&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (located at the top of the channel list) for upcoming Coffee Times and Classes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Requesting a more formal &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as Discord authorization has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in the corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Request/Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Class ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the Corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature of the request, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow Corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as access to the Forums has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in Corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as, after having properly authorized on Discord as a Signaleer, joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;== The Triple Crown Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At 11:30 UTC each day, Signaleers are recognized as the &#039;&#039;Daily Scout Leaders&#039;&#039; by the Allison bot in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/655834735121268736 #members-lounge]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; channel of our Discord server.  Thanks to [https://evewho.com/character/96293852 Sky Diamond], Allison bot tracks the:&lt;br /&gt;
* Top Cacher 👑 - most tending/sowing cache actions in the previous 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
* Top Thera Scanner 📡 - most Thera wormhole submissions in the previous 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
* Top Turnur Scanner 🛰️ - most Turnur wormhole submissions in the previous 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
* Top Storm Chaser 🌧️ - most new metaliminal storm reports in the previous 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== What is the Triple Crown? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In order to achieve the arduous yet prestigious Triple Crown, a Signaleer must simultaneously be the Top Cacher, the Top Scanner (Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;or&#039;&#039;&#039; Turnur), and the Top Storm Chaser within the &#039;&#039;&#039;SAME&#039;&#039;&#039; 24 hour time period (aka downtime to downtime).  A rare feat indeed! 🦄 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== What if I get ALL FOUR?! ===&lt;br /&gt;
If you are the Top Cacher, Top Thera Scanner, Top Turnur Scanner, and Top Storm Chaser within the same 24 hour period, well, we&#039;ll just have to invent a new club for you!  Is it even possible?  You never know until you try... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How to join the Triple Crown Club? ===&lt;br /&gt;
Post your screenshot in [https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1130610110826287307 this Discord forum thread] of your Triple Crown &#039;&#039;&#039;WITH&#039;&#039;&#039; the timestamp visible.  Easy, right? 😉     &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Also, if you like, please include some tips/tricks of how you achieved your Triple Crown in order to help other Signaleers attain this elite club membership.  By doing so, you’ll help us all become more knowledgeable, skilled, and efficient at serving the New Eden community.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Please also read [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/5670/signal-cartel-group-blog-relaunch this introduction forum post] for more information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Content Guidelines ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* This is a Signal Cartel blog: posts should focus on exploration, the Credo, our corp, or our alliance. We’re going to try expanding our content to include exploration both in game and out of game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Suitable content includes (but is not necessarily limited to) stories of your exploration adventures in New Eden, examples of the Credo in action, personal musings about our corp or culture, discussion of ships and fits for exploration activities, original fanfic or fan art that you created (art should be accompanied by some words about process or inspiration), in-character stories, and announcements of new guides or other resources you have created for public use. Real life exploration adventures, what inspires you to explore, latest scientific discoveries around space exploration, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Other ideas for post:&lt;br /&gt;
** In-character posts (1500 words or less) written by our pilots about their lives in game when they are not in their pods nor focused on Signal Cartel business. We&#039;ve seen some of these from our members over the years but we would like the kind of stories that indicate deeper thinking, issues being grappled with, etc....stuff that reveals a fully fleshed out character rather than a cardboard cutout. For example:&lt;br /&gt;
*** What do they do in their downtime?&lt;br /&gt;
*** Do they have serious hobbies?&lt;br /&gt;
*** Do they participate in local politics?&lt;br /&gt;
*** Do they have families that they see?&lt;br /&gt;
*** Do they have issues with managing their own subordinates? &lt;br /&gt;
** Well-reasoned well-written, respectful op-eds about changes to the game which affect Signal Cartel.&lt;br /&gt;
** Reflections from our pilots about their experience with game-related struggles and resolutions impacted by their membership in Signal Cartel. For example:&lt;br /&gt;
*** Interactions with outsiders in challenging situations&lt;br /&gt;
*** Decision struggles&lt;br /&gt;
*** Credo-compliant resolutions&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* All material posted on this group blog must comply with our Credo. To further clarify: Don&#039;t trash-talk or bash other players, groups, or playstyles. Avoid salty, non-constructive whining about game changes or mistakes by CCP or players (including yourself). Don&#039;t brag about stuff you did that violates or skates on the fine edge of our Credo, even if done on an alt (this is a blog by and about Signal Cartel members, not their out-of-corp alts). Our family-friendly policy applies to the group blog. Do not post NSFW embedded or linked material. In-character posts with mild conversational swearing are probably okay. Vulgar or sexually explicit slang or topics is a NOPE, not even with asterisks masking some of the words. To quote BRAVE, keep it classy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* The primary value of your post must be in what you write or create, not what others have created. Do not re-post dev or player blogs, EVE fan art or fanfic, or other content that you yourself didn&#039;t create. Link to them and write about them, sure. If linked material was not created by you, attribute the creator in a caption or inline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Journalistic articles may quote from other sources to support the topic you are writing about. You must attribute quoted material to its creator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Posts offering nothing but &amp;quot;helpful&amp;quot; linked lists of resources are discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Just because it&#039;s on the Internet doesn&#039;t mean you have the right to use it. Technically, all images are copyrighted by their creators at the moment of creation. Except for EVE-related images created by CCP or captured from in-game, use of any imagery for decorative illustration is to be avoided unless you provide a link to the image&#039;s Creative Commons licensing info.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* All posts containing memes images that are not Signal Cartel specific will be rejected. We have standards here, people. 👵🏽 &amp;lt;-- Spacemom Mynxee Look&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This list may evolve as situations arise which need to be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== How to submit your work? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With your first submission an email address will be needed for you to create your Contributor account (so your name can be set as the author).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== To Post Newly-Written Original Material: ====&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Paste your draft into a Google Doc.&lt;br /&gt;
* When your draft is ready for review, send Katia Sae an EVEmail with the subject &amp;quot;GROUP BLOG SUBMISSION: NEW POST&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
* Include a link that permits Katia to &#039;&#039;&#039;comment&#039;&#039;&#039; (NOT edit). Then we can collaborate as needed to get the post ready for prime time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== To Cross-Post From Your Blog: ====&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Send Katia Sae an EVEmail with the subject &amp;quot;GROUP BLOG SUBMISSION: BLOG X-POST&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
* Include in the email a link to the original post and any other relevant info.&lt;br /&gt;
* Send ONE EVEmail per submitted x-post. Submit only a few gems, not your entire catalog of blog posts.&lt;br /&gt;
* When we publish your cross-post on our group blog, we will link to the original post to help drive traffic to your blog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== To Cross-Post From Our Forums: ====&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* The post must have originally been authored by you.&lt;br /&gt;
* Consider whether the content is suitable for public view.&lt;br /&gt;
* If so, paste it into a Google Doc draft.&lt;br /&gt;
* In the draft, redact all names of non-Signal Cartel pilots unless you obtain permission from them to use their name in a public-facing post.&lt;br /&gt;
* If comments from other Signaleers add materially to the story, add them (with attribution) at the bottom your draft.&lt;br /&gt;
* When your draft is ready for review, send me an EVEmail with the subject &amp;quot;GROUP BLOG SUBMISSION: FORUM X-POST&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
* Include a link that permits me to &#039;&#039;&#039;comment&#039;&#039;&#039; (NOT edit). Then we can collaborate as needed to get the post ready for prime time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== To Suggest Page or Menu Additions/Changes: ====&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* EVEmail me with your suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;
* Subject line should be &amp;quot;SC Site Suggestion&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: &#039;&#039;&#039;Use the subject lines we&#039;ve suggested here, not your creative take on them.&#039;&#039;&#039; That will help me to parse my inbox faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over time, we expect to give regular contributors Contributor or Author privileges in WordPress, depending on the frequency and editorial quality of your posts. Eventually, we will consider giving Editor privileges to one or two trusted C2 members with demonstrated excellence in writing and editing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Editorial Quality and Decisions ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Katia Sae (and future Editors) will ride herd on the editorial quality of posts. We want our visitors to have an enjoyable reading experience here. Submissions that are poorly written, poorly organized, laden with typographical errors or misspellings, or which otherwise do not meet certain minimum editorial quality criteria will be subject to rework by the author before they will be published.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final decision on what is published on our group blog rests with Katia Sae. If something is deemed unsuitable for publication, comments in your Google draft will provide guidance as to issues and how they might be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Generally when there is a crush of submissions, we will choose to space their publication dates to feed new content out in a measured way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Questions? ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ask Katia Sae! We&#039;ll update the wiki page as necessary to cover them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Fancy Yourself a Wordsmith?  Why Not Write for Our Blog? ====&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever wanted to share a story? Show off your fan art skills? Write a helpful guide? But there’s not a public outlet available for you to do so or you don’t want to go to the trouble of starting a blog or site of your own. Welcome to the [https://signalcartel.org/ Signal Cartel Blog] where we’d like to host you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any Signal Cartel member may submit a post for our group blog. You are encouraged to share your exploration- or corp/alliance-related adventures, in-character musings, creative efforts, game features expertise, and research findings in the blog. You can also write about areas outside of EVE Online that are exploration-based but related to real life - such as a personal exploration journey of your own you’d like to share or a highlight of current space exploration events, like the relatively recent black hole image, Mars rovers, or new technologies, either science or gaming related. The overall theme of the group blog should be “exploration”, either in or out of EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;

We strongly encourage you to get involved and find your own niche.  This is an exploration-centric corp, so explore everything our corp has to offer as well as all of New Eden!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance#Leadership | Leadership]] has also made an explicit point of not being corp content generators.

=== In-Game Activities ===&lt;br /&gt;
==== Tend Wormhole Rescue Caches and Rescue Stranded Pilots with EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) ====&lt;br /&gt;
[[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR)]] is New Eden&#039;s premier wormhole rescue service and is one of the oldest divisions in Signal Cartel.  ESR consists of two programs:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_(ESRC) | EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)]]&lt;br /&gt;
** Provides a basic emergency resource kit for capsuleers stranded in wormholes, regardless of alliance, sovereignty, or playstyle.&lt;br /&gt;
** ESRC was previously discussed in the [[Orientation_Guide_-_First_Week#Participate_in_EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_.28ESRC.29 | Orientation Guide - First Week]].&lt;br /&gt;
* [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide | Search and Rescue (SAR)]]&lt;br /&gt;
** The SAR program is specifically organized to rescue capsuleers stranded in wormhole systems where there is no ESRC present, or in situations when a stranded capsuleer is unable to utilize the equipment in an existing rescue cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Scan and Map Thera and Turnur with Our EvE-Scout Mapping Division ====&lt;br /&gt;
* The [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping Division]] operates as a crowdsourced service tasked with scanning and recording the current wormhole access locations into and out of the hub systems of Thera and Turnur for the benefit of all of New Eden.  The wormholes are exclusively mapped by members of Signal Cartel. Our scouts are also compensated by the generous donations of capsuleers that find our service invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;
** Additionally, Tekufah and Samari Arila Enaka, fellow Signaleers, will generously donate a fitted Covert Ops ship to you if you try out mapping for the first time!  [https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1135167433754300506 Click here] for details!&lt;br /&gt;
* Wait, What are Thera and Turnur?&lt;br /&gt;
** According to Mynxee, Signal Cartel Co-founder, &amp;quot;[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera Thera] is a wormhole system akin to Grand Central station...on average, 20-some wormhole connections spawn there daily that go to locations all over New Eden: high-sec, low-sec, null-sec, and other wormholes. People--especially explorers, but also many PvP&#039;ers--use Thera as a convenient shortcut to move quickly around New Eden.&amp;quot; You may wish to visit Thera for use as a travel hub, to see the sights there, or to participate in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning | EvE-Scout Mapping]]. Thera Scanning is the original project that lead to the creation of EvE-Scout Enclave and Signal Cartel!&lt;br /&gt;
** Recently, the system of Turnur has become a nexus system much like Thera, except located in low-security space.  However, this wasn&#039;t always the case. After an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/breaking-turnur-devastated-by-extreme-stellar-event extreme stellar event] devastated the system, a large number of wormhole connections spontaneously opened up for reasons unknown.  This tragic event presented an opportunity for EvE-Scout to expand our mapping services to Turnur.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Track Dangerous Storms Across New Eden with Our Signal Cartel Storm Tracking Service ====&lt;br /&gt;
Nullsec is currently experiencing wandering storms that slowly travel between systems called [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Metaliminal_Storms Metaliminal Storms].  These weather events produce a variety of environmental effects that impact all ships brave enough to enter them.  Help us report the stormy weather for the benefit of all capsuleers!&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Signal_Cartel_Storm_Tracking_Service|Click here]] to learn how to track storms with us!&lt;br /&gt;

* The [[FOD:Fleet_Operations_Division | Fleet Ops Division (FOD)]] is a group of Signaleers with varying levels of experience in commanding, supporting, and participating in fleet operations; the goal is for all of us to improve our skills, build confidence, “try on” new roles in a safe environment and have some fun with our corpmates along the way.  Participating in Fleets is also a terrific way to meet your fellow Signaleers, create lasting bonds and shared memories!  Remember, Signal Cartel fleets are PvE only.&lt;br /&gt;

===== Create and Organize Your Own Fleet or Event! =====&lt;br /&gt;
If you don&#039;t see any fleets or events that strike your fancy, we have a solution: take the reins, point us in the right direction, and lead us on an adventure!&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;Protip:&#039;&#039; Organizing a [[Orientation_Guide_-_First_Week#Hug_Someone|Hugs Fleet]] is a terrific low-pressure way to get your fleet feet wet!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Fleets:&lt;br /&gt;
** Please post your fleet in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128778733092880514 🗪ready-room]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;

&#039;&#039;&#039;NOTE:&#039;&#039;&#039;  In either case, don&#039;t forget to promote it so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Tour the Wonders of New Eden and Share Your Experiences with Signal Cartel Expedition TripTiks ====&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel Expedition TripTiks provide a list of interesting beacons, landmarks, or other sites of interest in New Eden that would make for a fun expedition either solo or in a group. Each TripTik provides summarized info for each site and links to more in-depth external resources.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Signal_Cartel_Expedition_TripTiks |Click here]] for more info or to get involved.&lt;br /&gt;
:: &#039;&#039;Special Note:&#039;&#039; Make sure your list includes a trip to the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|&#039;&#039;&#039;Journey of Katia Sae Memorial&#039;&#039;&#039;]]!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Love Exploration but Still Want to Do Some Space Trucking or Industry on the Side?  We have You Covered. ====&lt;br /&gt;
While hauling with your Signal Cartel character is not advised due to frequent [[Policy:War_Dec_Eligibility | wardecs]], there is an alternative.  [[Crikey_Freight | Crikey Freight]] is a hauling and industry corp set up by Signal Cartel members. All members are the out-of-corp alts of Signaleers, and they are immune to wardecs.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Crikey_Freight#Crikey_Freight_Wants_You.28r_Alt.29.21|Crikey Freight Wants You(r Alt)!]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Work Towards Joining the Anoikis Division (AD) and LIVE in a Wormhole! ====&lt;br /&gt;
Jumping through your first wormhole can be a scary proposition.  Exploring the unknown of J-space can be even scarier.  Permanently living there?!  You must be crazy!  Well, not for our brave members of the [[AD:Anoikis_Division | Anoikis Division (AD)]] that elevate wormhole living to an art form.  Living in a wormhole provides its own unique set of challenges - constantly changing ingress/egress routes, sporadic access to trade hubs and known-space jump clones, and constant danger from PvP-focused pilots and corps. The rewards, other than ISK, are vast - thrills, excitement, camaraderie, and just plain fun!  It&#039;s Wormhole Living at its Finest!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a partial list of activities that AD members can pursue:&lt;br /&gt;
* The explorer’s mainstay of scanning and hacking of data/relic sites.&lt;br /&gt;
* PvE Combat: Sleeper sites and other NPCs in our wormhole, as well as other systems accessed through connecting wormholes.&lt;br /&gt;
* Planetary Interaction (PI): A good way to generate a passive income. Our wormhole has several planets and can produce, up to and including, P4 products.&lt;br /&gt;
* Mining: Random spawns of ore, ice fields and gas clouds within and outside of our wormhole. We also have a moondrill for extraction of moon ore for mining.&lt;br /&gt;
* Industrial: Manufacturing and reprocessing. Other industrial services, such as Invention, Reactions, are available.&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in the Corp’s Search and Rescue (SAR) and EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) programs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If interested, Signaleers must meet the AD&#039;s [[AD:Anoikis_Division#Eligibility_to_Join|eligibility requirements]].  Therefore, while you can&#039;t join the AD within your first month, you can start your journey towards living the wormhole life now!  [[AD:Anoikis_Division|Click here]] for more info on the AD.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Out-of-Game Activities ===&lt;br /&gt;

* However, the SCA isn&#039;t meant to be a one-way street of knowledge given from on high.  As [[User:Xalyar|Xalyar]], the founder of SCA has stated, &amp;quot;Our goal is to provide the needed tools to facilitate the meeting of mentors and students, where anyone can volunteer their time and knowledge - thus becoming a &#039;&#039;&#039;mentor&#039;&#039;&#039; - for the benefit of anyone - thus becoming a student - who feels they need unfulfilled guidance.&amp;quot;  So scratch that teaching itch by offering up your expertise for the benefit of all Signaleers!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;*Not a thing&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== Join the EVE Echoes Chapter of Signal Cartel ====&lt;br /&gt;

The [[EvE-Scout_Wormhole_Research_Center|EvE-Scout Wormhole Research Center]]&#039;s purpose is to gather and verify wormhole information with the goal of forming our own static wormhole data collection.  Ultimately, this may one day result in a cool new service to New Eden!&lt;br /&gt;
* Visit the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1113777681725665340 #research-center]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; channel on the EvE-Scout Enclave Discord server to participate and learn more.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
The last section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities, services, and tools that new pilots can utilize during their first month in the corporation &#039;&#039;and beyond&#039;&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We realize this is a lot to take in, so take your time, enjoy yourself, and note that there are no mandates upon your activities other than to be an active member of our corp.  If you set some goals and fly safe (or dangerous), you&#039;ll eventually carve out your own niche within Signal Cartel.       &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you will see, Signal Cartel provides a friendly, nurturing home that includes great benefits and opportunities for learning, fun, and profit.  Let&#039;s get this section started and finish strong!   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== How Can I Get Involved In Corp Activities? ==&lt;br /&gt;
{{:Corp_Activities}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Services Available to Corp Members ==&lt;br /&gt;
EVE is hard. Playing EVE alone is even harder. In Signal Cartel, in addition to helpful discourse, the corp offers a range of services to aid all our members.  Please take advantage of these opportunities - it&#039;s why they&#039;re offered!&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Corp_Services|Click here]] to learn more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Useful Corp Tools ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel uses various out-of-game tools and programs to assist in our exploration efforts. Utilizing some or all of these tools will help make the game more enjoyable by increasing your situational awareness, productivity, and ability to serve New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Corp_Tools|Click here]] to learn more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== AFK Thread ==&lt;br /&gt;
You just joined, so why go AFK?  Real life happens though, so if you plan to be away from the game for less than 60 days please let us know by making a post in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪hello-farewell-afk&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.  Be sure to use the &amp;quot;AFK&amp;quot; tag when you post. It&#039;s not necessary but is nice and will keep us from wondering what happened to you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Signal Cartel Swag Store ==&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Signal_Cartel_Swag_Store | Signal Cartel Swag Store]] has a twofold purpose: to distribute &#039;&#039;awesome merchandise&#039;&#039; to our &#039;&#039;awesome members&#039;&#039; and to help us cover the real-life overhead for all our &#039;&#039;awesome services&#039;&#039;. While infrastructure costs are not incredibly high, management appreciates any and all help; after all, ISK won&#039;t pay for everything! To this end, please note that all store profits will be used to support corp services.  Represent your new corp in style and help us keep the RL lights on!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Conclusion ==&lt;br /&gt;
Whew!  You made it!  Congratulations!  We hope the &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel New Member Orientation Guide&#039;&#039;&#039; has been helpful to you.  Now the real adventure begins.  If you haven&#039;t already, undock that ship and start exploring the wonders of New Eden.  o7&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial|Journey of Katia Sae Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Request/Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Class ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the Corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature of the request, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow Corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as access to the Forums has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in Corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as, after having properly authorized on Discord as a Signaleer, joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;

While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[Katia_Sae_Monument|1420:Journey_of_Katia_Sae_Memorial]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the Corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature of the request, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow Corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as access to the Forums has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in Corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as, after having properly authorized on Discord as a Signaleer, joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[Katia_Sae_Monument|Katia Sae Monument]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
== Request/Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Class ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the Corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature of the request, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow Corp members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as access to the Forums has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[SCA:Session_Posting_Guidelines_for_Discord|&#039;&#039;&#039;Click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]] for more detailed information on how to properly format a class request&lt;br /&gt;
* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in Corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as, after having properly authorized on Discord as a Signaleer, joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &#039;&#039;&#039;NOTE:&#039;&#039;&#039; The Signal Cartel Epic Arc is &#039;&#039;&#039;Not&#039;&#039;&#039; Currently Accepting Sign Ups.&lt;br /&gt;
 If a Signaleer is interested in reviving this worthwhile project - please reach out to &#039;&#039;&#039;Katia Sae&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Aldar Roanaok&#039;&#039;&#039;! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did you know that Signal Cartel is developing our very own in-house Epic Arc?  For those unfamiliar, Epic Arcs are chains of in-game missions available from specific agents around New Eden. The missions are typically more difficult but provide unique rewards based on the specific Arc.  The list of official EVE Epic Arcs is available [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Epic_arcs here].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Signal Cartel Epic Arc is a custom set of missions exclusive to our corp and overseen by a select group of fellow Signaleers that act as Game Masters (GMs).  Our Epic Arc provides a fun and immersive role-playing environment in which to learn about exploration, our services, and corp culture.  Give it a try, it&#039;ll be Epic!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!-- &lt;br /&gt;
== Sign Up for the Signal Cartel Epic Arc ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel Epic Arc is a sequence of missions which are designed to familiarise Signaleers with the basics of exploration as well as Signal Cartel&#039;s services. The Arc is being developed by a group of corp members who also act as Game Masters. Currently, the Arc has only one part which helps new Eve Online players develop their exploration skills such as scanning and hacking. The missions do not have rewards, but they are educational and are based on a mysterious background story. Also, there is no time limit, so the players can run the missions at their leisure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mission runners who would like to sign up can do so via [https://forms.gle/JgV6CwSbxDH288Ag7 this Google Form]. If you want to participate in the Arc development please contact [https://evewho.com/character/2116718162 Amos Nakrar] or Corp Leadership.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;big&amp;gt;&#039;&#039;&#039;Hello and Welcome to Signal Cartel!&#039;&#039;&#039;&amp;lt;/big&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel New Member Orientation Guide&#039;&#039;&#039; is designed to help you get started on your journey as a “Signaleer”, our affectionate name for a Signal Cartel capsuleer. It provides critical information on our policies, communication channels, apps, services, and divisions within the corp. If you are new to EVE, we have a number of resources available to help you develop the skills and knowledge to successfully explore New Eden. We regularly hold talks and classes on many aspects of the game that are designed for new and experienced pilots alike.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Please note that Signal Cartel utilizes EVE Online to verify your identity and corp membership.  For possibly the first 24 hours* after you join us, you may be unable to access our non-public/protected corp systems and assets.  Read below for more info regarding this topic.&lt;br /&gt;
 *Exception: forums.eve-scout.com may take up to 7 days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== The Credo ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the moment you joined Signal Cartel, our &#039;&#039;&#039;[[Public:About_Signal_Cartel#Corp_Credo | Credo]]&#039;&#039;&#039; is no longer an abstract idea. Every action of a Signaleer is expected to be compliant with the Credo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some Credo statements, such as the prohibition of “initiating aggression on other players’ ships, pods, or deployed structures,” are unambiguous, and there is no excuse to breach such requirements. Others describe concepts and ideals that may be subject to interpretation. For example, the meaning of neutrality has been a topic of some robust debates within the corporation. A Credo-compliant course of action may not be obvious in every situation; Signaleers are expected to use their best judgment and, if in doubt, discuss the options with experienced corp mates and management.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the Credo, Signal Cartel has a number of policies that corp members must know and follow. You will get access to all policies within 24 hours of joining the corp, but for now, please take note of our Code of Conduct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Code of Conduct ==&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the [[Public:About_Signal_Cartel#Corp_Credo | Credo]], we have a family-friendly rule, both in both language and topic, for all in- and out-of-game communications channels/platforms. This extends to character biographies, character names, and includes any linked content. Many of our members have children or early teens who may be watching or listening to them play. Therefore, we do not tolerate toxic, vulgar, hateful, mean-spirited, or foul-natured conduct or language.  We do not tolerate drama or rabble-rousing. The one thing we hear most often from departing or returning members is that “this is the nicest corp and group of people I’ve ever met in a game” and that is exactly how we aim to keep it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, Signal Cartel members recognize the dignity and worth of every person in New Eden. Our aim is to create a climate of understanding and mutual respect so that each person feels a part of and is able to contribute to our community. To that end, discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to age, sex, gender, sexual identity, nationality, or ethnicity, is not tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, please avoid real-life (RL) politics, religion, and other controversial RL topics in all our communication channels/platforms. Members are here to play a game, enjoy each other&#039;s company, escape RL for a bit, and have fun. Conversations should primarily be related to the game and associated events and meta activities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Observed or reported conduct violations are reviewed by Leadership.  Generally, Signal Cartel has a Two Strikes and Out policy which will be explained later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Wars ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel does not declare wars, but wars are often declared against us by other corporations and alliances. While we are at war, members of the aggressor corporation may freely attack Signaleers in high security (high-sec) space. If the corporation is already at war when you joined Signal Cartel, you will not receive any notification but the top-left corner of your game client screen will contain this symbol:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:WarsImage.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While we are at war, extra caution is recommended while navigating high-sec. Here are some tips which will increase your chance of survival:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Avoid trade hubs (Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, Hek, Rens) and choke point systems along the popular trade routes that lead to them (ex. Ahbazon, Sivala, Tama, and Uedama).&lt;br /&gt;
* Use the free Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS) to safely move your stuff to one of our corporation bases in high-sec.&lt;br /&gt;
** More info on SCRAMS will be provided later in this guide. &lt;br /&gt;
* Use [https://carrier-logistics.space/ Carrier Logistics] to sell your loot without having to haul it to a trade hub.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Your First 24 Hours ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many out-of-game tools and communication channels used by Signal Cartel are available to corp members only. They rely on EVE to verify your identity and corp membership. Due to the way that EVE updates your information, you may find that you are unable to access our out-of-game systems until the next EVE downtime. This could take up to 24 hours (or up to 7 days for our old [https://forums.eve-scout.com/ EvE-Scout Forums] that are now in read-only mode), depending on the time you joined the corp. This is entirely normal and does not mean that your application has been rejected or that there is a problem with your membership invite. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite temporarily not being able to access certain out-of-game corp assets within the first 24 hours of joining Signal Cartel, there are still a number of optional things you can do during this waiting period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some suggested activities:&lt;br /&gt;
* Enable the “Auto Reject Dueling Invitations” setting to prevent inadvertent Credo violations, as participating in duels will be viewed as directly seeking PVP. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Auto_reject_dueling_ssgrab.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Train Anchoring skill to level 1. This is an essential skill for Signaleers who wish to participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache program as it is required to sow a replacement rescue cache.  Training Anchoring to 1 will take you just under half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;
** The Anchoring skillbook is available to &amp;quot;buy and inject&amp;quot; and is also on the market for usually a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;
** Additionally, our Station Quartermasters have this skillbook stocked in our corp hangars. Ask a fellow Signaleer that has a C2 title for details!  &lt;br /&gt;
* Connect to a few of our shared bookmark folders:&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Signal Cartel&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; folder is found in the Corp in-game chat channel&lt;br /&gt;
** &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;EVE-Scout \\ Thera&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; folder is found in both the Alliance and Corp in-game chat channels&lt;br /&gt;
* Install [https://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome] browser. Signal Cartel uses a number of out-of-game tools, such as our co-pilot, Allison. These typically work in various browsers, but our Engineering team officially supports only Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;
* Start learning the lingo. If you are completely new to EVE Online, this can be a daunting task.  Here are two resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - a browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
** [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any questions or need help, please post to the in-game Alliance chat channel (we do not use the Corp channel) or the public channel of our [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server|Discord server]] - there will be a number of members willing to help. Even if you don’t have any questions or issues, feel free to just say hello. We’re very happy to meet you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Who Is Who ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a number of [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Org_Chart|key personnel]] within Signal Cartel who you will encounter on a regular basis. These individuals are responsible for leading our organization and also for the [[Public:Divisions | various programs and initiatives]] within Signal Cartel.

&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Important:&#039;&#039;&#039; As soon as you gain access to the protected areas of this wiki and our corp Discord, you must read the next section of the New Member Orientation Guide and complete the mandatory tasks within their stipulated timeframes.   [[Orientation Guide - Mandatory Tasks|&#039;&#039;&#039;Please click here to move on to the next section.&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}Signal Cartel offers its members a multitude of meaningful and fun activities, many of which are covered later in this guide. Although the topics are presented in a particular order, Signaleers are encouraged to pick and choose things that interest them. The only exception to this is a series of one-off tasks which new members &#039;&#039;&#039;MUST&#039;&#039;&#039; accomplish within a defined period of time:&lt;br /&gt;
* Read ALL our policies. &lt;br /&gt;
* Set up Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
* Publish an introduction.&lt;br /&gt;
* Meet Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While at first glance this list may look daunting, just tackle it bit by bit and you&#039;ll finish in no time.  However, since we&#039;re all real people with real-life obligations, if something comes up that prevents you from completing these tasks, please let [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Leadership]] know.  They&#039;ll be happy to help you get things sorted.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note:  While you still need to complete all the Mandatory Tasks, there is no strict requirement to finish all the tasks before engaging in other aspects of Signal Cartel corporate life.  So don&#039;t feel like you have to read everything before starting your journey with us!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Immediately: Read Orange Policies ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Policy:The_Credo | Signal Cartel’s Credo]] is supported by a number of policies that clarify its application. As these policies facilitate compliance with the Credo, Signaleers are expected to know and follow them. No excuses. Although all policies are equally important, reading and digesting them in one sitting can be an overwhelming task. For this reason, they are grouped by reading priority:&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:orange&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Orange List Policies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; must be read as soon as a new member gains access to Signal Cartel resources.&lt;br /&gt;
* &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:yellow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yellow List Policies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; (see below) must be read within 7 days of joining Signal Cartel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#1 To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; [[Policy:List_of_Policies|Read Signal Cartel’s policies in the &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:orange&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Orange List&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First 72 Hours: ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Set Up Discord ===&lt;br /&gt;
EvE-Scout Enclave, our Discord server, is the main communication platform used by Signal Cartel.  It&#039;s where we all go to hang out and discuss serious and not-so-serious topics.  Certain channels on the server are also open to the general public, free for all to join, and host a number of people from outside the corporation as guests, together with many New Eden pilots waiting or asking for rescue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining our Discord server and properly authenticating yourself is mandatory for all new corp members.  Discord is also an essential tool for those wishing to take part in our EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC), Search and Rescue (SAR), and EvE-Scout Mapping programs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After being in the corporation for &#039;&#039;at least 24 hours&#039;&#039;, new members (like you!) will be able to authenticate yourself on our Discord server. Doing so will grant you the &#039;&#039;Signaleer&#039;&#039; role on Discord and access to our members-only channels. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#2a To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; Join our Discord server and authenticate yourself using our [[Discord_Authentication_Guide|👉&#039;&#039;&#039;Discord Authentication Guide&#039;&#039;&#039;👈]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: Check out our [[Discord_Channel_Guide|Discord Channel Guide]] for a listing of all our channels along with descriptions. Our [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers|Ping Trigger Quick Reference Guide]] has the most used &amp;amp; useful ping triggers to help you get in touch with people holding different roles within Signal Cartel.  Also, check out [[Public:EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Server#Slash_Commands|Allison&#039;s slash commands]] for fun and useful information provided by our favorite bot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Publish an Introduction ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are required to publish an introductory post on our Discord server within 72 hours of joining. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The recommended format of your post is:&lt;br /&gt;
 * What brought you to EVE, how long you’ve played, and what kinds of things you’ve done in-game?&lt;br /&gt;
 * What inspired or how you came up with your character&#039;s name?&lt;br /&gt;
 * How you discovered Signal Cartel and what attracted you to it?&lt;br /&gt;
 * Anything about your real life that you are comfortable sharing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please remember to keep all your communications, including this intro post, family-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#2b To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; Make an intro post in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128086787605151764 hello-farewell-afk]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.  Be sure to use the &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; tag when you post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First Week: Read Yellow Policies ==&lt;br /&gt;
By the end of the first week in Signal Cartel, new members must acquaint themselves with the remaining corporation policies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#3 To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039; [[Policy:List_of_Policies|Read Signal Cartel’s policies in the &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;background:yellow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yellow List&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== First Week: Meet Allison ==&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, by the end of the first week, new members must meet Allison, our official Signal Cartel Co-Pilot. She is implemented as a web application that works in the background and does not interfere with the EVE game client. Her presence is essential for our EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division, which consists of two programs:&lt;br /&gt;
* EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) - You&#039;ll learn more about this program on the next page of the Orientation Guide.&lt;br /&gt;
* Search and Rescue (SAR)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if Signaleers do not want to actively participate in ESR, they can still assist with our SAR efforts of stranded capsuleers by flying through Wormhole Space with Allison enabled.  With Allison enabled, you will help us locate lost pilots just by having Allison passively running in the background. For new pilots, this may be the easiest and the quickest way to become a contributing member of the corporation, while also having an opportunity to earn ISK if you locate a lost pilot! For more information about the role of the Locator in our SAR efforts, please [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide#Role_of_the_Locator|click here]].  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note that although getting acquainted with Allison is a mandatory part of Signal Cartel&#039;s New Member Orientation, pilots are free to deactivate Allison afterward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;#4 To-do:&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
# [[ENG:The_Signal_Cartel_Official_Guide_to_Co-Pilot_(Allison)| Read The Signal Cartel Official Guide to Co-Pilot (Allison)]]&lt;br /&gt;
# [[ENG:Allison_is_a_Spai_(Required_Reading) | Read about Allison, your privacy, and how it relates to ESR]]&lt;br /&gt;
# [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/ Load and activate Allison], and then visit Wormhole Space (aka Anoikis or J-space).  Basically, scan down a wormhole and jump through!  Protip:  [[In-system_navigation_and_maneuvering#Safes,_Bookmarks,_Perches_and_All_That|Don&#039;t forget to bookmark your exit]]!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{{Orientation Guide|all}}&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the Orientation Guide provides useful information about Signal Cartel and also lists a number of activities that new members can comfortably participate in during their first week with little to no experience.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#039;t worry though, because other than completing the [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks|Mandatory Tasks]] on the previous page, the rest of this guide contains no additional mandates or time-sensitive requirements.  You are encouraged to freely explore our offerings at your own pace and blaze your own trail.  Signaleers are explorers after all!  So dig in and have fun, but remember to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Learn the Lexicon ==&lt;br /&gt;
As previously mentioned, if you are completely new to EVE Online, learning the game terminology and slang can be a daunting task.  Additionally, Signal Cartel uses unique terms and abbreviations that can make getting a handle on things even harder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some resources that will help:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Learn_the_Lingo|Learn the Lingo]] - Common slang and words used by EVE players in general and Signal Cartel in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:New_Eden_Word_Bank_(NEWB)|New Eden Word Bank (NEWB)]] - A browser extension designed to help new players automagically translate and understand EVE-related jargon.&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon EVE Lexicon] - Abbreviations and terms commonly used in EVE Online (from EVE University)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Consider Joining Buddy Club ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[Buddy_Club|Buddy Club]] is an opt-in service within the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy|Signal Cartel Academy]] that pairs new members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer in EVE Online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVE Online has a notoriously [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg steep learning curve]. In addition, Signal Cartel plays EVE on [[Credo_FAQ|Hard Mode]] because of our strict adherence to [[Policy:The_Credo|The Credo]]. Buddy Club aims to help new members overcome these barriers to entry and smooth out the learning curve to make becoming a Signaleer easier and more enjoyable.  Therefore, Buddy Club benefits all new Signal Cartel members regardless of whether they are completely new to EVE or a veteran pilot of New Eden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Buddy Club Info ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club is a completely optional service offered to new members&lt;br /&gt;
* Pairings last for one month&lt;br /&gt;
* Participation in Buddy Club does not limit or strict any corp activities&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddies are helpers, not supervisors&lt;br /&gt;
* Buddy Club requires the use of Discord&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about Buddy Club, please [[Buddy_Club|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How To Request a Buddy? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* Please request a Buddy using the &#039;&#039;/buddy&#039;&#039; command in any of our Discord channels.&lt;br /&gt;
* New members are assigned Buddies by the [[Buddy_Club|Assistant Manager for Matchmaking]] based on best fit including language and time zone considerations. After approximately 48 hours, you will receive a DM from Allison indicating who your new Buddy is and your Buddy will contact you on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Relocate to a Corporate Base ==&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel has three main offices in high security (high-sec) space:&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Zoohen&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Zoohen III - Theology Council Tribunal&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Gelhan&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Gelhan V - Moon 10 - DED Logistic Support&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Saisio&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Saisio VIII - Moon 4 - Perkone Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members may want to consider moving their belongings and medical clone to one of them.  To do so, you are encouraged to take advantage of our free [[SCRAMS|&#039;&#039;&#039;Signal Cartel Relocation And Moving Service (SCRAMS)&#039;&#039;&#039;]].  Please read the [[SCRAMS]] page and then contact [[User:Xavec|Xavec]] to coordinate the safe relocation of your stuff.  Please note that relocation is completely optional and only offered for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits of making one of these bases your home station include convenient access to [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corp contracts and hangars]] along with proximity to fellow Signaleers.  All of these stations offer roughly the same services, but Zoohen has emerged as the most popular and is where most fleets formup. Also of note, Saisio lacks clone bay facilities (for jump clones), but the system does have the [[Katia_Sae_Monument|Katia Sae Monument]]!&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Members may also wish to relocate to Signal Cartel&#039;s headquarters in [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera &#039;&#039;&#039;Thera&#039;&#039;&#039;]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Station: &#039;&#039;Thera XII - The Sanctuary Institute of Paleocybernetics&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The advantage of having a base in Thera is that it provides a good starting point for any trip since it has a high number of wormhole connections to New Eden and Anoikis (aka Wormhole Space or J-space) and allows easy participation in [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping]]. However, new members should weigh this convenience against potential hazards before making a decision to relocate to the HQ.  Thera is more dangerous than an average J-space system because of the NPC stations, and certain entrance wormholes are often actively camped by resident PVP corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
----&lt;br /&gt;
Our newest corporate office is located in Turnur, which is in low security (low-sec) space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Solar System: &#039;&#039;&#039;Turnur&#039;&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
:Station: &#039;&#039;Turnur III - Moon 17 - Boundless Creation Factory&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turnur has become a nexus, much like Thera, allowing us to expand our [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|scanning services]] to the system.  More recently, an [https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-ancient-jovian-stargates-discovered ancient Jovian stargate] was discovered in Turnur leading to the dangerous new system of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Zarzakh Zarzakh].  Just like with Thera, new members should be aware that Turnur is hazardous and often actively camped.  However, mysteries await those experienced enough to explore it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Set Up Exploration Skill Training Queue ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed training plan focuses on essential exploration skills which include scanning, hacking, cloaking, and operation of ships. Before starting the training, players must decide which racial frigates they want to fly and choose the relevant &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate skill, for example, Caldari Frigate for a Heron. This choice does not depend on the player’s race - any race may fly any ship. However, new players will be able to start flying ships produced by the empire they belong to a little faster as &amp;lt;Racial&amp;gt; Frigate I is included in their starting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level to which skills can be trained and, consequently, which modules and ships can be used depends on the state of a player’s clone: &#039;&#039;&#039;Alpha (𝛂)&#039;&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;&#039;Omega (𝛀)&#039;&#039;&#039;. The limits for each skill are indicated in the plan below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completing the whole plan will take a significant amount of time. The speed of training depends on a character’s attributes, such as Intelligence and Perception - the higher the attributes the faster the training of skills that require them. There are two ways to increase attribute scores and, therefore, reduce the training time: neural remap and implants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Neural remap ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A player has the ability to reallocate points between attributes in order to optimize training time. Such a decision must be made after due consideration as neural remap is only possible once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the plan below, the fastest training time is achieved with this map:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Intelligence: 27&lt;br /&gt;
* Perception: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Charisma: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Willpower: 	17&lt;br /&gt;
* Memory: 	21&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remap can be initiated by pressing the &#039;&#039;Remap Now&#039;&#039; button on the Character Sheet -&amp;gt; Character -&amp;gt; Attributes tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;&#039;&#039;Note:&#039;&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;This is a &#039;&#039;&#039;suggested&#039;&#039;&#039; attribute remap and is &#039;&#039;&#039;not mandatory&#039;&#039;&#039; in any way.&#039;&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Implants ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character attributes can be boosted by the use of implants. For example, Cybernetic Subprocessor and Memory Augmentation implants improve Intelligence and Memory attributes by 1 to 7 points, depending on the model. Thus, the “Basic” variation gives +3 bonus and costs about 10 million ISK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike neural remap, implants are physical objects which are inserted into a clone which means that they are not transferred during clone jumps and will be destroyed if the pilot&#039;s pod is destroyed (podded).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase I: T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Signal Cartel provides free fitted T1 exploration frigates to its members, available through &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|Corporation contracts]]&#039;&#039;&#039; in all offices. The first phase of the training plan contains the skills required to use them. Some fittings also have drones but the skills needed to operate them are not included in the plan as drones are not necessary for exploration.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the fittings include modules that are not available to alpha clones, it is possible to engage in exploration activities without them, simply unfitting the modules for which skills are not available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase II: Advanced T1 Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phase will improve a pilot’s rate of success in scanning and hacking using T1 modules. Magnate pilots who struggle with scanning down higher-level signatures might consider trading a microwarpdrive for a scan rangefinding array.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase III: T1 Frigate with T2 modules ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills trained in this phase will provide a quantum leap in pilots’ scanning and hacking abilities by enabling them to use Tech II modules.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVa: Covert Ops Frigate ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While T1 frigates provide a cheap option to get started on exploration, serious explorers should develop skills that will eventually enable them to fly Tech II Covert Ops ships. T2 exploration frigates provide superior hacking and scanning bonuses and can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices and Interdiction Nullifier modules (to help escape bubbles) both of which significantly improve the ships’ survivability.&lt;br /&gt;

|}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Phase IVb: Astero ===&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Astero is a versatile exploration ship that also has impressive combat bonuses and is quick to align (&amp;lt;2 seconds when properly fitted). Skills required to fly an Astero can be trained very quickly, but it’s also one of the most expensive frigates in the game. One of the strongest Astero bonuses is that it, just like Covert Ops frigates, can use a Covert Ops Cloaking Device. It is not recommended to use an Astero without a CovOps cloak, therefore Alpha clones are discouraged from flying this ship.  Also, the Astero cannot fit Interdiction Nullifier modules and is surpassed in scanning ability by Covert Ops Frigates once Covert Ops IV is trained. &lt;br /&gt;

== Sign Up for the Signal Cartel Epic Arc ==&lt;br /&gt;
Did you know that Signal Cartel is developing our very own in-house Epic Arc?  For those unfamiliar, Epic Arcs are chains of in-game missions available from specific agents around New Eden. The missions are typically more difficult but provide unique rewards based on the specific Arc.  The list of official EVE Epic Arcs is available [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Epic_arcs here].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Signal_Cartel_Epic_Arc|Signal Cartel Epic Arc]] is a custom set of missions exclusive to our corp and overseen by a select group of fellow Signaleers that act as Game Masters (GMs).  Our Epic Arc provides a fun and immersive role-playing environment in which to learn about exploration, our services, and corp culture.  Give it a try, it&#039;ll be Epic!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* To learn more about the Signal Cartel Epic Arc, please [[Signal_Cartel_Epic_Arc|&#039;&#039;&#039;click here&#039;&#039;&#039;]]&lt;br /&gt;
* To sign up to participate, please fill out [https://forms.gle/JgV6CwSbxDH288Ag7 &#039;&#039;&#039;this form&#039;&#039;&#039;]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Request/Attend a Signal Cartel Academy Class ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of the [[SCA:Signal_Cartel_Academy | Signal Cartel Academy (SCA)]] is to provide a way to share the wealth of knowledge already present within the ranks of the Corporation to those that might need it. There are aspects of this that are inherently linked with what we specifically do (like our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue Division]] activities) and others that are more generic and related to the understanding of game mechanics as a whole. Regardless of the nature of the request, the SCA aims to assist new and returning players joining Signal Cartel with a way to ask for (and offer) help in order to tap into knowledge held by fellow Corp members.&lt;br /&gt;

Requesting a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; is extremely easy, and it&#039;s something that can be done as soon as access to the Forums has been granted by posting a [NEED] titled thread in our &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1128416903992459274 🗪education-need-offer]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel.&lt;br /&gt;

* Every Signaleer is encouraged (especially new members) to be proactive in requesting mentorship&lt;br /&gt;
* On the other side of the spectrum, everyone is also likewise encouraged to volunteer their time to share their knowledge in a similar fashion, through the posting of an [OFFER] thread under similar rules as above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Academy is open to all, regardless of seniority in Corporation, and welcomes classes that cover all aspects of EVE mechanics and topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attending a class is extremely easy. It could be as simple as, after having properly authorized on Discord as a Signaleer, joining one of the voice channels (generally &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/647770427728592927 🕪sca-auditorium]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) to follow the lecture (voice is optional, so you can just listen in). At times, a specific requirement in-game about fits or location will also be posted and will need to be organized, but most of the classes will generally be held in a classroom-style setting with just the need for participation on Discord.&lt;br /&gt;

== Participate in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) ==&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all who wander are lost. But some people do get stuck in wormholes and have no way to get out. In such cases, our [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue | EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Division]] helps them by directing the stranded pilot to one of our rescue caches if they can use the probes and launcher we’ve left there, or by mounting a direct rescue effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Participating in EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC) program is one of the &#039;&#039;easiest&#039;&#039; ways to contribute to the corporation and the community. All you need (besides learning the procedure) is an exploration frigate and supplies for the caches, which are all available on free corp contracts at any Signal Cartel base!  Please &#039;&#039;&#039;[[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|click here]]&#039;&#039;&#039; to learn more about our corp contracts and how to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly, a rescue cache is a password-protected small secure container anchored in an Anoikis system. It must contain one Core Probe Launcher I and eight Core Scanner Probes I. If a stranded pilot has the ability to equip the Core Probe Launcher, or already has one and just needs probes, they will be directed to the cache and given a password to open it. With the launcher and the probes, the pilot can then scan their own way out of Anoikis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to participate in ESRC program, Signaleers &#039;&#039;&#039;must fly&#039;&#039;&#039; with [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/login.php Allison] turned &#039;&#039;&#039;on&#039;&#039;&#039;, especially when exploring in J-space. When a Signal Cartel pilot enters an Anoikis system, Allison informs them if there is a cache in that system and whether it needs attention. If there is no cache present, then a new cache needs to be sown, i.e. deployed, anchored, and filled with supplies. If there is a cache already present, then it may need to be tended which simply means opened and checked for content. An anchored small secure container will expire in 30 days if it’s not opened. Every time the container is opened, the expiration timer is reset to the full 30 days. Therefore it is important to visit each rescue cache periodically and tend it, marking it appropriately through Allison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
🛑 &#039;&#039;&#039;ATTENTION: Before you participate in the ESRC program, it is &#039;&#039;MANDATORY&#039;&#039; to read the following guides and pages:&#039;&#039;&#039; 🛑&lt;br /&gt;

== Hug Someone ==&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Hugs for Dummies.png|300px|right|Hugs for Dummies]]&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Policy:The_Credo|Credo]] does not allow Signaleers to initiate aggression, but it does allow them to fit Festival Launchers, hurl snowballs and fireworks at unsuspecting targets, and banter light-heartedly in Local! Such treatment of other EVE players is known as “giving a hug”, and the fleets dedicated to this activity are called “Hugs Fleets”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugs Fleets can be organized for any reason: to pay a visit to wardeccers, to scare the living daylights out of miners, or to spread goodwill and good cheer at random around New Eden. The price of this fun is usually the ship in which the fun is being had. The loss of your ship in a Hugs Fleet is almost a certainty and is expected by all participants. This, in turn, simplifies Fleet Commanding duties to the point that any Corp member, regardless of experience, can and is encouraged to be a Fleet Commander (FC) for one such fleet. The cost of the ship, however, should not discourage a space-poor player from participating in Hugs Fleets, since suitable ships, festival launchers, and fireworks are available for free on [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|&#039;&#039;&#039;corp contracts&#039;&#039;&#039;]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New members are encouraged to participate in and organize Hugs Fleets, as they are a great way to get to know fellow corp mates and find new friends. No experience is required! If you are interested in organizing your very own Hugs Fleet:&lt;br /&gt;
* Watch this informative [https://youtu.be/moECn3W95D0 video on how-to FC a Hugs Fleet] (recommended, but not required) &lt;br /&gt;
* Please post your announcement in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;🗪ready-room&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Discord forum channel by using the [[How_to_Create_a_Fleet_Announcement|Fleet Announcement Template]].  &lt;br /&gt;
* Don&#039;t forget to promote your event so people show up ([[How_to_Promote_Your_Fleet_Op_or_Event|click here]] for some tips).  Everyone knows the best hugs are group hugs! &lt;br /&gt;

== Help! You&#039;ve Got Questions, We&#039;ve Got Answers ==&lt;br /&gt;
While the New Member Orientation Guide is designed to help you get started on your journey as a Signaleer, more nuanced and advanced questions often require the help of one of our veteran players.  We are always happy and willing to help you in your journey. Here is how to reach out to one of our live(ly) customer service representatives (aka your fellow corp mates):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Who Do I Contact? ===&lt;br /&gt;
In general, any veteran Signaleer should be able to either answer your question or point you in the right direction.  However, if you are looking for someone specific, please see these handy pages:&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance|Who Does What and Who To Contact in the Corp/Alliance]]&lt;br /&gt;
* [[Public:EvE-Scout Enclave Org Chart|Alliance Chain of Command Chart]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== How Do I Contact Them? ===&lt;br /&gt;
* [https://discord.gg/fKy3FeZ Discord] is likely your best bet.  It is the most actively monitored communication medium (in- and out-of-game) and you&#039;ll probably receive an answer regardless of time zone.&lt;br /&gt;
** [[Orientation_Guide_-_Mandatory_Tasks#Set_Up_Discord|See the previous page]] for how to set up Discord.  Please remember that setting up Discord is mandatory.   &lt;br /&gt;
** Also, please review the following [[EvE-Scout_Enclave_Discord_Ping_Triggers | Discord Ping Triggers]] and use them as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
* Alliance Chat (in-game channel) - Our main in-game chat channel.  Allows communication with corp members that are in-game with you.  Immensely helpful and fun if you are both logged in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;
