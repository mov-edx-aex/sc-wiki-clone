The '''EvE-Scout Rescue Cache (ESRC)''' program, founded in early YC118 by [https://evewho.com/character/94791801 Forcha Alendare], provides a basic emergency resource kit for capsuleers stranded in wormholes, regardless of alliance, sovereignty, or playstyle. The ESRC is one of the two main activities of the [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue|EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) division]], the other being that of [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide|'''Search and Rescue (SAR)''']]. As well as being an ancillary service to the EVE community, the ESRC program provides Signal Cartel members an opportunity to expand their exploration experiences, wormhole lifestyle, and game play content, as well as being a prospective ISK earning opportunity.

==Terms==
The following terms are used within this document:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Term !! Definition
|-
| Dispatcher || A Scout who interacts with and aids a stranded capsuleer in need.
|-
| Cache || A container that has been anchored and has a minimum of one (1) Core Probe Launcher and eight (8) Core Scanner Probes in it.
|-
| Container/Canister || A small secure container. ESRC does not use any other size or variety.
|-
| Hug || Any firework, snowball, or other novelty item placed in a Cache to bring cheer to the stranded pilot.
|-
| Scout || Any member of Signal Cartel working in space to help a stranded pilot.
|-
| Sow(n)/Sowed || A Cache that has been anchored in space. Anchoring prevents the Cache from being scooped up into a ship’s cargo hold and allows it to remain in space for the full 30-day duration of the timer. This timer is refreshed/extended when opening the Cache.
|-
| Sower || Scout who Sows the Cache.
|-
| Tend(ed)/Maintain(ed) || Extending a Cache's life, verifying Cache content, etc.
|-
| Tender || The last Scout to tend the Cache.
|-
| Agent || The 911 Operator who gives a stranded pilot access to our cache. Also, the action for recording said information on Allison.
|-
| Locator || A pilot who finds an open SAR system.
|-
| Celestial Object || Planet or Sun.
|}

&lt;b>Note:&lt;/b> Roles (Sower/Tender/Locator) are not assigned. The informal terms are used only for convenience and clarification. Any Scout can perform the duties of any "role" any time they wish. As an example, it is very common for a Scout to both Sow and Tend caches as the situation requires.

==What is a Rescue Cache?==
A Rescue Cache is a small secure container that contains one Core Probe Launcher and at least eight Core Scanner Probes (and, optionally, a few hugs for fun) which is anchored somewhere in a wormhole system.  
When a capsuleer is stranded and in need, they can contact a Scout in the in-game public &lt;code>EvE-Scout&lt;/code> channel or via the [https://evescoutrescue.com/911 Rescue 911] website for assistance. 
After assessing the situation, the Scout may direct the stranded capsuleer to the location of one of our Rescue Caches along with the password to open it.  The capsuleer will then take what they need and scan their way out of the wormhole to safety.

==The Database==
It is necessary to collect key information about caches (location, passwords, etc.) so that it may be passed on to stranded pilots. We maintain an online database for just this purpose. The database collects inputs from everyone (Management, Scouts, Sowers, Tenders, and Agents). It is vital that the information it contains be both accurate and timely. The database is accessible directly at [https://evescoutrescue.com evescoutrescue.com] or while using our co-pilot Allison at [https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot evescoutrescue.com/copilot].

===ESRC Database===
Whether accessed directly or through Allison, the database provides a way to enter and retrieve information about individual wormhole systems. It can be used to check the status of a given wormhole system's Cache, sow a new Cache, tend an existing one, or help a capsuleer as an Agent. This page also features helpful statistics about program participation, as well as information about a given wormhole system from helpful third-party tools.

'''Note:''' For security reasons, the ability to EDIT cache data is limited to EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) Coordinators and the ''most recent sower within 7 days'' without regard to player location. If cache data in the database is incorrect, please contact a [https://evescoutrescue.com/home/about.php ESR Coordinator] and provide any necessary details.

===Entering Notes===
Adding meaningful notes is highly encouraged. Try to keep them short and to the point. Please limit your notes to essential things that need communicating to the next tender/sower or, in the case of systems, to information that might persist in time. Since the coordinator team gets notified for every new note, any notes that is implicit in your TENDING action should be avoided (add hugs, but no need to make a note for it).

==ESRC Shared Bookmarks==
The ESRC program utilizes a series of shared folders that contain bookmarks for the rescue cache locations.  '''Use them!'''
* Links to the shared folders are located in our in-game ''Corp Bulletins'' by navigating here:&lt;br />&lt;code>Neocom Menu &amp;rarr; Social &amp;rarr; Corporation &amp;rarr; My Corporation (tab) &amp;rarr; Bulletins (subtab)&lt;/code> under "B5: EvE-Scout Rescue Shared Bookmarks". 
* Full information on using bookmarks can be found in the [[ESR:EvE-Scout Rescue Cache Shared Bookmarks | EvE-Scout Rescue Cache Shared Bookmarks page]].

==Supplies==
Rescue Cache supplies are available for free to Scouts at our offices in Gelhan, Saisio, Thera, and Zoohen. The supplies are available on contract to the corporation (check your available contracts), or housed within the station’s Corporate Hangar, in a shared hangar named ESRC Inventory. To access this hangar, you must have a [[Policy:Corp_Admin_Info_and_Policies#Member_Levels:_C1.2FC2_Titles|C2 title]]. If you are not yet C2 just ask someone in Alliance chat to contract you some supplies if there are none on contract in one of our office stations already. [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|'''Click here''']] to learn more about corporation contracts and hangars and how to obtain these supplies.

===Small Secure Containers===
''Sowers'' will need to bring along containers. We use Small Secure Containers. They are the least expensive option and take up the least cargo space (10m&lt;sup>3&lt;/sup> when packaged). Standard or Large containers are ''not'' authorized.

&lt;b>Note:&lt;/b> You can launch a packaged container and it will automatically assemble itself in space, so there is no need to assemble containers before you undock.

===Cache Contents===
Both ''Sowers'' and ''Tenders'' will need to ensure their cargo bays contain enough supplies to fill or restock caches.

Minimum cache contents are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Item !! Quantity
|-
| Core Probe Launcher I || 1
|-
| Core Scanner Probe I || 8
|-
| Hugs (fireworks, snowballs, etc.) || optional
|}
'''Note:''' Effective 3-12-2022, Noise-5 “Needlejack” Filaments are no longer required in caches.  This is due to a [https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/patch-notes-version-20-02 recent game patch] by CCP rendering Needlejack filaments inoperable within wormhole space.

Be sure to pick up enough probes and launchers to place into each of the Caches you plan to sow or tend. If available, bring along a few "hugs" too, to drop in the Cache as well. We usually leave at least one hug for the stranded pilot, just for luck. Additional scanner probes may optionally be placed in Caches, as well.

==Co-Pilot "Allison"==
[[ENG:The_Signal_Cartel_Official_Guide_to_Co-Pilot_(Allison) |'''ALLISON''']] (Artificial Life Limited In Scope to Onboard Navigation) is our Signal Cartel resident Co-Pilot.

Designed from the ground up with the Rescue program in mind, flying with Allison is '''mandatory''' for all pilots who wish to participate in our Rescue programs. But why wouldn't you want to have our chatty AI keep you company in the depths of wormhole space? Among other services, Allison provides the following helpful audio notifications about the ESRC pilot’s current wormhole system:

*Rescue Cache status
*Active SAR requests
*Wormhole class
*Recent kills
*Reminder to bookmark entry wormhole
*D-scan reminder

In addition to these helpful reminders, Allison also provides insights into existential considerations, spouts poetry, and offers weather forecasts of dubious utility. Just remember, her original design parameters do not go beyond onboard navigation, so anything outside of that realm must be taken with a grain of salt. (She has quite an [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/1624/on-the-origin-of-allison interesting history].)

==Sower - Anchoring the Cache==
The Sower is responsible for initially anchoring and filling the rescue cache. Of all the roles, they have the most preparation to do.

===Advanced Preparation===
* Scouts who sow caches must have &lt;code>Anchoring I&lt;/code> skill trained.
** The Anchoring skillbook is available to "buy and inject" and is also on the market for usually a lower price.
** Additionally, this skillbook is free for the taking from our ''Shared Stuff'' corp hangar. [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars#Corporation_Hangars|Click here]] for details on how to access our corp hangars.
* Setting up an [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/2256/a-newbie-cacher-s-guide-to-newbie-cachers-err-or-whatever ESRC inventory filter] before heading out can be useful, especially if your cargo hold will also be full of other items.

====Pick Up Supplies====
Don't forget to pick up some [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_(ESRC)#Supplies|supplies]] (i.e., containers, probes, probe launchers, hugs) before heading out.

===Find a Wormhole===
This is simple enough. Just don't forget to pack your own set of probes! You don't want to be the first to use your own cache! (Now that would be embarrassing.)

===Check for an Existing Cache===
Allison will notify you of the status of the rescue cache in the current system as soon as you enter. If no cache currently exists get ready to sow one! If there is one already and Allison says it needs to be tended, see the [[#Tender - Maintaining the Cache |"Tender - Maintaining the Cache"]] section below.
[[File:Sow New Cache.png|400px|center]]

Note if sowing a cache using an existing bookmark you can use the "Same as last cache" button once you've selected "Sow New Cache". This will automatically enter the cache information.
[[File:Sow-new-cache-bookmark.png|400px|center]]

===Where to Sow a New Cache===
There are two main methods to find a suitable location for a new cache.  The first and easiest way (when possible) is to reuse the old cache's bookmark.  The second way is to use the "Bounce Method".  Both are detailed below.
 
====Reuse the Old Cache Bookmark====
*You can usually reuse the old cache's bookmark to sow a new one at the previous location: [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_Shared_Bookmarks | EvE-Scout Rescue Cache Shared Bookmarks]].
** Caches will naturally expire after 30 days if they are not tended.
* However, if it seems like the cache was not naturally expired (ie. it was destroyed) or a bookmark doesn't exist, please select another location planet (see below for details).

====Location, Location, Location====
With the exception of Thera, all wormholes (C1-C6, Shattered, etc.) are viable candidates for rescue caches. Once inside the wormhole, it is all about...location, location, location!

Caches should be sown between 22,000 and 50,000 km from a planet. This will be off-grid in most cases, yet still easy enough to travel to.
*If the cache is too visible or too close to locals, there is a good chance someone will tamper with or ambush it. (This is a good possibility anyway, but there is no need to make it any easier for them.) Out of D-Scan range of an anchored structure is a good rule-of-thumb.
*Avoid dangerous locations, being mindful of objects that may de-cloak capsuleers near the cache.
*Do not place the cache such that it might be confused with something more dangerous.
*Do not place the cache such that it might impact or interfere with the locals.
*Caches must be not be too difficult to reach (e.g., cache location should not require flying through the location planet from the planet's warp-to-zero point).
*The cache location should not require flying through the location planet. An easy way to ensure this is for the align planet to be closer to the star than the location planet.
*More information on cache placement can be found in this post on the Forums: [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/1253/esrc-complicated-geometries ESRC Complicated Geometries]
*Caches must not be too far out of the way (in other words, don't place it at your 40 AU safe spot).
*Caches should not be visible (on-grid) from any planet, moon, structure, or the star.
*Always use the planet’s warp-to-0 point itself as your align point, not the Customs Office (if one is present). While it is often safer to warp to the CO, planetary geometries present too many situations where the cache cannot be reliably located after it is sown if you align it using a CO.
*If caches are regularly being destroyed in a system contact a member of the [https://evescoutrescue.com/home/about.php ESR Coordinator Team] (ping '''@ESR-Coordinator''' on [https://discord.gg/0qn6aJxK8iwEfiwF Discord] or message one in-game if they are online) to get approval to sow an unaligned cache. If you are unsure as to how to sow an unaligned cache the coordinator will instruct you.
*Don't use the star unless system has only one planet.
*&lt;b>Note:&lt;/b> Gas planets typically break our expected geometry patterns. The warp-in point can be as much as 20,000 km from the planet surface, thus causing caches sown at even 30,000 km from the planet to be on-grid and visible from the warp-in point. Avoid using gas planets as a location planet. If you sow a cache at a gas planet, please make sure to sow it toward the higher end of the range (50,000 km) and ensure it is not on-grid from the planet's warp-in point.

====The “Bounce Method"====
With a suitable location identified for the cache (the “location planet”), choose a suitable planet to align with (the “align planet”). This is the starting point for actually sowing the cache, as well as a reference point to aid stranded capsuleers in finding the cache when they need it. From the selected align planet you will warp to the location planet using the “bounce” method. 

We have dedicated public page describing this method, which can be shared with a pilot in need, at this  [https://evescoutrescue.com/bounce link] in English, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. 

The method is also described in detail [[Public:Bounce_Method_Instructions_(en)|here]].
[[File:BounceMethodEnglish.jpg|frameless|center|900px]]

====Did We Mention That Preparation Is Vital?====
Sowing the cache is the most vulnerable point for the Sower during this whole process. To launch and fill the container, you’ll need to be uncloaked, quite possibly up to a full minute or more. So preparation is vital in speeding the sowing process and ensuring you’re uncloaked for the shortest possible time.

Quickly take note of the following information (note that you'll need this for the next this step):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Term !! Definition
|-
| Location (i.e., “rescue cache planet”) || Planet or object the cache is nearest to.
|-
| Alignment (i.e., “align planet”) || The planet or object that the cache is aligned too (should never be dead space).
|-
| Distance || Distance the cache is located from the Location Planet (not the distance from the planet’s warp-in point itself, the difference can be a few thousand kilometres)
|-
| Password || The cache password is pre-generated by Allison on the ESRC web page. You can copy it from there by clicking the clipboard icon on the interface.
|}

Also, be sure to get your cargo prepared and ready to go. If you have more than one item each in your cargo bay, take the time to separate the container, launcher, and probes in the cargo bay. (Hold SHIFT while dragging icon to empty space in bay, then select the quantity you want to split into a separate stack.) Have the cache name and password readily available to quickly copy-and-paste.

===Sowing the Cache===
Once you are at a location to sow the cache (using either the old bookmark or the "Bounce Method"):

#Open cargo bay (sort contents).
#If you are cloaked, uncloak.
#Right click on container in cargo bay and select '''Launch for Self'''. If container is in a stack, only one will launch. (Note: You can launch a packaged container and it will automatically assemble itself in space, so there is no need to assemble containers before you undock. If you have cargo space you can assemble a single container and load it up prior to launching to save time while uncloaked.)
#'''ANCHOR THE CACHE. This step is crucial.''' Right click on the container and select Anchor. This will take 60 seconds to complete. (When anchoring has completed, it can be verified by right-clicking the container to view the context menu. "Anchor" will have been replaced by "Unanchor".) You do not need to remain near the container while the anchoring process is ongoing.
#Open container and drop in the cache contents (don’t forget a hug or two if you have them).
#Orbit the container at a safe distance (more than 2000m) in order to cloak up.
#Right-click on the container and select Set Name (Note: Steps 7-11 can be performed while the container is anchoring).
##Enter the following cache name:&lt;/p>&lt;code>EvE-Scout Rescue Cache - Stranded in this wormhole? Request help in the EvE-Scout channel.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>(After you do this once, you can just [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/2470/another-esrc-tips-for-newbies select the name from the dropdown] in the future.)
#Right-click on container and select Set New Password.
#Copy the password from the ESRC web page and paste it into the password and password confirmation fields.
#Submit cache information on the Sower data entry form on the ESRC web page or through Allison. If using the bookmark method you can simply click the "Same as last cache" button to automatically enter the cache information.
#Confirm that the cache is anchored. This step is mandatory. (Right-click the container to view the context menu. "Anchor" will have been replaced by "Unanchor".)
#If you didn't reuse the old bookmark, bookmark the cache in the '''ESRC New Bookmarks''' folder. Name the bookmark using the bookmark text available in the ESRC web page on Allison.
#Warp to safe.

===Verify The Information===
Once you’re in a safe location or moved away from the cache to a relative safe distance, verify that the information you've recorded about the cache is correct. You are able to edit a cache you sow yourself for seven days after you sow it. Do a couple more D-Scans to ensure you haven't attracted too much attention. Once all checked and good, jump to the next wormhole.

If you want to verify the password of the newly-sown cache, you seem to need to log off and back on again; if attempting to open a container in the same session you create it, it opens automatically without supplying a password.

==Tender - Maintaining the Cache==
The Tender is responsible for maintaining the Rescue Cache. If untouched, containers expire after 30 days. However, a container's "life timer" is refreshed by opening it. As the Tender, you’re also responsible for scouting the area and recording notes on a cache’s condition. Any scout can perform maintenance on caches. The last scout to open and maintain a cache is known as the Tender.

This role is not as labor intensive as the Sower. However, it is just as dangerous as the Sower role, which is why this role shares equally in distribution of ISK donations.

===Advance Preparation===
*There are no specific skill requirements for Tenders.
*Tenders can find Rescue Cache supplies on contract at Signal Cartel offices.
*Tenders who have the [[Policy:Corp_Admin_Info_and_Policies#Member_Levels:_C1.2FC2_Titles|C2 title]] will be able to retrieve supplies from the [[CS:Corporation_Contracts_and_Hangars|corporate ESRC Inventory hanger]] in Signal Cartel offices.
*Tenders must ensure they carry enough supplies to restock any cache they come across.

===Finding a Cache===
Allison will notify you upon entering the system whether it has a rescue cache in need of being tended. If not, see the [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_(ESRC)#Sower_-_Anchoring_the_Cache|"Sower - Anchoring the Cache"]] section above. If there is a cache to tend, the info on its location will be displayed on the ESRC web page. There will also likely be a [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_Shared_Bookmarks|bookmark available in the appropriate bookmark folder]].

====Forcha’s Tip====
May the "Force Field" not be with you. Before approaching or opening a cache, scout the area to ensure it is safe to work the cache. Are there any warp bubbles, wrecks, or ships on d-scan with it? These are signs the system may be active.

===Performing Maintenance===
#Verify location and alignment information of the cache via the ESRC web page. If there are concerns about the location, see the “Relocation” subsection below.
#Locate the cache using one of two approaches: 
## [[ESR:EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_Shared_Bookmarks|'''Bookmarks''']], if available, are the easiest way to quickly locate the cache
## Use the [[EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_(ESRC)#The_.E2.80.9CBounce.E2.80.9D_Method|“'''Bounce Method'''”]], if a bookmark isn't available or you want more of a challenge, until the cache is on-grid with you and can be warped to.
#Warp to the cache.
#Make sure there is only one cache on grid and the cache is not on grid with any other object.
#Check the ownership of the cache. If it is not '''[SC0UT][1420.]''' (the EvE-Scout/Signal Cartel tickers) then the cache will need to be relocated (see below). The most common reason for this is the original cache sower has left Signal Cartel.

[[File:Cache ownership.png|800px|frameless]]

#Check the name of the cache. It should be &lt;/p>&lt;code>EvE-Scout Rescue Cache - Stranded in this wormhole? Request help in the EvE-Scout channel.&lt;/code>&lt;/p> If it's something else, tend it as unusable and relocate the cache at different planet.

#Open the cache using the password listed. Copy it from the ESRC web page by clicking on the clipboard icon. This will help eliminate typing errors. If the container cannot be opened using the password, make a note of it. (Note: Sometimes an extra space gets entered at the end of a password when the cache is first set up. If the password doesn't work, always try it with an extra space at the end and see if that works instead.)
#Inventory contents and resupply if needed.
#Move away, cloak, and warp to safe.
#Submit the cache status via the Tender data entry form on the ESRC web page.

[[File:Allison Display.png|800px|frameless]]

====Password Issues====
It is possible the password on record does not work. In this case:

#Check the ownership of the cache and ensure it is Signal Cartel. If it is not then a new cache will need to be sown (see below). This can happen if the original sower leaves corp or if another corp is placing containers to look like our caches.
#It is also possible the database marked the cache expired when it did not actually expire. This can happen if someone tended and did not record it or if the database expired the cache a day early. The password will be shown in the History section of the Cache tab of the ESRC page in Allison.

===Relocation===
Existing caches cannot be moved. If a cache needs to be either resown or relocated, for any reason:

#The existing cache should be emptied and noted in the database as expired via the Tender data entry form, and
#A new cache should be anchored and supplied at a different planet. This new cache should then be entered into the database via the Sower data entry form, as outlined in the [[EvE-Scout_Rescue_Cache_(ESRC)#Sower - Anchoring the Cache|Sower - Anchoring the Cache]] section.

== Hugs policy ==

Different hug items in caches (snowballs, fireworks...) are small fun items for our lost pilots to enjoy. Those are not "geocaching" items for us. Having those in caches is purely optional, only a launcher and a set of probes are mandatory.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li> Only 1-2 stacks of hugs per cache is recommended. Our lost pilots are often in a stressful situation, we don't want to clutter their view with unnecessary huge amount of items. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>No corpses or ESS bounties.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other living things at your own discretion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid taking things out from caches unless it is something mentioned in #2&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

==Dispatcher – Aiding the Stranded==
The Dispatcher is the 911 Rescue Operator who will make contact with a stranded capsuleer. They will gather intel from them on their location, needs, and situation; and assist them in locating and opening the cache. In order to serve in this role, please review the [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide|Search and Rescue Guide]].

==I found an open SAR system - now what?==
While roaming around Anoikis tending caches, it might happen that you stumble upon an open SAR (Search and Rescue) system. Congratulations, you are now a Locator! When this happens, Allison will notify you and simultaneously ping the ESR Coordinator team. You should find a safe spot in the system and wait for a Coordinator to contact you in game. More info on the role of the Locator is available [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide#Role_of_the_Locator|here]].

==Dealing with Complaints==
Sometimes wormhole residents and others may complain about the location or the very existence of one of our rescue caches. If you are acting as a Sower or Tender and are in a position to safely respond to the complaint, please use your best judgment in doing so (e.g., relocate or remove a cache).

The bottom line is simple and straightforward: If someone has a legitimate presence as a resident of a given wormhole and asks that we not sow rescue caches there or do so only according to certain guidelines, we will honor their request if it is in our power to do so. If this request is made ask them to directly email the ESR Director (currently [https://evewho.com/character/2112425049 Xalyar]) with their request. Do not email on their behalf. We require direct contact from the requesting party.

If you are not sure how best to respond or would rather not do so, that is fine. Whether you are able to address the concerns being raised or not, please notify the ESR Director (currently [https://evewho.com/character/2112425049 Xalyar]) of any and all complaints that arise, and be sure to advise any aggrieved parties to contact the director directly.

==Compensation==
Participating in the ESRC program is an ISK earning opportunity for Signal Cartel members. ESRC is a community service program, supported by donations. This includes the donation of supplies, containers, members' time, and ISK. ESRC distributes 500m ISK per week to its participants, using a model similar to that of the [[TS:Thera_and_Turnur_Scanning|EvE-Scout Mapping Division]].

Payouts occur weekly and are handled by the [[Who_Does_What_and_Who_To_Contact_in_the_Corp/Alliance#Division_Managers|ESR Management Team]]. Payout amounts fluctuate from week-to-week. What Johnny-Splunk has stated about the Thera Wormhole Scanning program applies to ESRC as well: "''Your results will vary based on the effort you put in...You won't always get rich doing it, but you will be supporting a valuable service.''"

==Medals==
Medals are awarded to Scouts at each of the following levels:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Medal !! Level
|-
|SuperCacher || Sow or tend 100 rescue caches
|-
|MegaCacher || Sow or tend 300 rescue caches
|-
|HyperCacher || Sow or tend 500 rescue caches
|-
|UltraCacher || Sow or tend 1,000 rescue caches
|-
|HeroicCacher || Sow or tend 3,000 rescue caches
|-
|InsaneCacher || Sow or tend 5,000 rescue caches
|-
|The Crinkle Crown || Sow or tend 10,000 rescue caches
|}

A [https://evescoutrescue.com/home/heroes.php Hall of Cache Heroes] (Hall of Fame) is available on the EvE-Scout Rescue website that lists all of the amazing pilots who have achieved each of these levels of valor and heroism. You have New Eden's undying gratitude. o7

==Tips==
If you receive a tip of ISK for your help as a Sower, Tender, or Agent, you are welcome to do with it as you see fit: keep it all for yourself, share it with others who helped facilitate a given rescue, donate it to EvE-Scout, or jettison it into space. Tips are strictly optional and at the discretion of the pilot being rescued. We DO NOT solicit tips. If asked about them by an interested potential donor, the standard line is: “Tips are not required, but are always greatly appreciated.” Capsuleers wishing to donate to the program or corporation as a whole can find instructions [https://evescoutrescue.com/home/donate.php our website].

==FAQ==
{|
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''Why not sow mobile depots for stranded pilots who need to fit a probe launcher?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || Mobile depots will not work for at least three reasons:
*They cannot be stored in containers of any kind.
*They can only be used by the pilot who launches them into space.
*They can be combat probed
|-
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''How does a stranded pilot use the Probe Launcher in a rescue cache without a way to fit it?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || Some pilots carry a mobile depot with them or there may be a freeport in the system they can dock at. Otherwise, if they don’t already have a probe launcher fitted, the cache will be of limited use to them. Remember, ESRC is only able to provide rudimentary aid. We do the best we can with what we’ve got!
|-
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''What about a huge network of of Alpha pilots in every wormhole who can just scout stranded pilots out?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || It’s an interesting idea, isn’t it? Folks have been discussing this since basically the first day Alphas were announced. Two things make this a really hard nut to crack:
*Admin and logistics are a real nightmare across 2604 wormhole systems.
*Potential Credo violations are an even bigger nightmare, given the hundreds of pilots it would take to pull this off.
If you have specific ideas about how to address either or both of these two concerns, please let [https://evewho.com/character/2112425049 Xalyar] know!
|-
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''What about just flying into the wormhole with the stranded pilot and scouting them out?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || This is what our [[ESR:Search_And_Rescue_(SAR)_Full_Guide|Search and Rescue (SAR) program]] does.
|-
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''The data entry form/search tool are broken/lousy/hard to use. What can I do to make them better?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || We are always working to make our systems easier to use. If you have a specific idea, please leave a comment in the &lt;code>[https://discord.com/channels/152437634927427584/1097827204982898778 #esr-lounge]&lt;/code> channel of our Discord server. Thanks.
|-
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''I just don’t feel like it’s worth it to participate in this program. What should I do?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || Signal Cartel is a service organization, but ESRC is only one of many ways for you to be of service to New Eden. If this isn’t your cup of tea, there are many other fine brews to sample!
|-
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Q:''' || ''How did we come up with the sowing range of between 22,000 and 50,000 km?''
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''A:''' || A lot of research has gone into figuring this out! You can read some of the more recent discussion about it on our forums by following the links below:
* [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/1187/esrc-max-seeding-distance Old EvE-Scout Forum: max seeding distance]
